R16TLM2XCMG35W,ronnie reazon ,"Hector Gracia, born in Spain, is an author and an aspiring philosopher. He has been living in Japan for 18 years. He worked as a software engineer in Switzerland before moving to Japan. His most well-known books are Ikigai, A Geek in Japan, and Ichigo Ichie.Francesc Miralles, also born in Spain, is an award-winning author of fiction, self-help, and inspirational books. He studied journalism, English literature, and German. He has also worked as an editor, translator, ghostwriter, and musician. He is well-known for his book Ikigai and Love in Lowercase.The authors of Ikigai have interviewed hundreds of centenarians of Japan to unravel their secret of being young and happy, even at an old age. Most of the Japanese belonged to Okinawa, a Japanese Island, where 24 people out of 100,000 are over the age of 100- far more than the global average. Women of Okinawa live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world. The book contains lessons based on what these Japanese centenarians eat and drink, how they treat their work and their style of living.The book introduces the concept of ikigai and how it helps the Japanese people live a healthy life even at an old age. Then the authors describe the secrets of anti-aging and how stress can degrade our health. Concepts of Logo-therapy and case studies where people found their purpose are described. The basic principles of Morita Therapy are also explained. In the next chapter, the authors explain flow, three steps through which flow can be achieved in work, and how you can discover your ikigai with the help of flow.The following chapters contain some information about Japanese centenarians and their philosophy, habits, lifestyle, and diet. Then the book explains some yoga and exercises of Japanese people which keeps them healthy. The last chapter contains the concept of resilience and antifragility, which can help you handle lifeâ€™s challenges without getting broken. The book ends with an epilogue that includes the ten rules of ikigai.Three key lessons which I have learned from the book is as follows-(1)â€œIkigaiâ€ is a Japanese word that means- a reason for living, a meaning for living. Having an ikigai means having a clear purpose that makes our life worthwhile. Your ikigai is something you love (watching Netflix, scrolling Instagram, sleeping, etc. wonâ€™t count), you are good at, you can be paid for, and something the world needs. For example, if you love singing a lot and are good at it, your ikigai is probably singing. The world needs good songs, and you can be paid for them.So, first, you need to find your ikigai or purpose, and then you should constantly take action to fulfill this purpose. The good news is this action wouldnâ€™t seem boring because it will give a sense of satisfaction. If you have a definite purpose, an Ikigai, you would never feel lost.â€œHe who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.â€-Viktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist(2)Work with the flowWe all have experienced a situation in our lives where we lost track of time. It may be when you were reading a book, and you got so much immersed in it that you didnâ€™t realize how 3 hours passed like a flash of light. But there are also times when the opposite happens, and time doesnâ€™t pass at all. You have probably experienced this during a boring lecture. What causes this difference? Why does time pass slowly when we do something that we donâ€™t like while it passes swiftly when we do something of our interest?The answer is flow. Ta-dah! The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term flow and described it as the pleasure we feel when we completely immerse ourselves in what we are doing. According to him,The state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at a great cost, for the sheer shake of doing it.When we are in a state of flow, we focus on our work and not on distractions. The intensity of focus leads to Deep Work which increases our productivity and at the same time gives satisfaction. Once we find flow in our work, the work will be fun.(3)Be resilientThis is the most powerful lesson which I learned from the book Ikigaiâ€“ to be resilient. Resilience is defined as the ability to withstand harm without getting weakened. It means to accept everything life throws at us, without blaming others, without getting frustrated, without feeling discouraged.When you have a clearly defined ikigai, you have to pursue it no matter how difficult the situation becomes. You canâ€™t give up even if things are not going according to your expectation. Thatâ€™s when the importance of resilience comes. Resilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the easier it will be to handle the obstacles without getting broken. Those who are resilient, they are good at dealing with negative situations without getting discouraged. They adapt to changes and concentrate only on those things which they can change.What did i liked about Ikigai?First of all, I liked the concept of ikigai and how our ikigai can help us live a meaningful life. This is life-changing. The concept of flow and how to experience flow in our work was the most beautiful chapter in the book. I liked it so much that I made notes of this concept. I also liked the part where the authors describe resilience and anti-fragility.The book made me feel the importance of slowing down, being in the moment, and showing gratitude for every small thing I have in this life. This book helped me to live with peace, make friends, and enjoy each and every moment. I donâ€™t know; the book is a kind of magic, which made me realize that there is nothing to worry about but only to be happy. I was happy after reading it.What didnâ€™t I like about Ikigai?Before reading the book, I expected that this book is all about ikigai and finding purpose and will help me find my own. But when I read it, I found that it doesnâ€™t contain much information about finding ikigai, which disappointed me. The book includes advice about exercises and eating vegetables, which are somewhat familiar and can be found in any blog. These were the few things that I didnâ€™t like in the book.Is Ikigai worth reading?Yes, the book Ikigai is worth reading because it contains many powerful and proven concepts which can help you to improve your way of living. It can help you realize the value of a purposeful life and find your purpose. In todayâ€™s stressful and fast-paced world, we rarely get any time to heal our body, mind, and soul. This book can help you to understand the importance of slowing down and being in the present. If you feel bored in life, Ikigai can help you to enjoy and get lost in your work. This book contains interviews of Japanese centenarians, which would motivate you to live a simple life with high thinking. I found all the lessons highly practical, which anyone can easily implement in their life and get remarkable results.Who should read Ikigai?The book Ikigai must be read by all those people who donâ€™t enjoy their work and are frustrated, or who are stressed and busy in their work and hardly live their life, or who doesnâ€™t have a purpose in life and feels lost, or who are discouraged by failures, or all of the above. This book can also help those people who donâ€™t have a good lifestyle, eat junk foods, donâ€™t exercise, drink and smoke, etc. Ikigai can make anyone understand the importance of living a purposeful life. I will recommend this book to anyone who wants to live a long, happy, and purposeful life.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 7 January 2023,IN DETAIL'S BEFORE YOU INVEST YOUR TIME IN IT,4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819-HgBPT6L.jpg,171

R1Y6LYA3EVVHII,LibroReview,"I personally believe that having a purpose on in life and then giving it your all is the most important to lead a happy life. This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of itâ€™s extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, youâ€™ll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japanâ€™s Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book youâ€™ll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and itâ€™s content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, itâ€™s very cozy. In itâ€™s own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read. I was ready to take on my tasks stress-free. Though it is not something extremely crazy and different, it definitely is a one-time read for all the hustlers or non-hustlers out there who think they have to punish themselves to get what they want.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 8 April 2019,The best book to read during your break time.,4,,466

R9QMYPSIX1FPV,Nalin Rai,"The title of the book suggests that it is unravelling The Japanese Secrets to a Long and Happy Life, but it also does incorporate the key elements from Indian way of life i.e.Yoga and the Chinese way of life i.e. Tai Chi. Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu,  and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However  one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing.  There should not be any distraction or multi-tasking at all as it does not help anyway. To attain the flow, the authors have requested to adopt the policy of leaving the cell phones one hour before going to sleep, and one hour after getting up. Tough act to adopt? Each one of us has a passion inside us or the Ikigai and if we have found it we need to practice and fine tune it, and if not yet, it is incumbent upon us to discover it.NALIN RAI",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 9 April 2020,Be Slow and Things would fall in Place,5,,2

R3N8G6DHB2PH41,Ramesh Iyer,"This print edition seems different from what I have seen in bookstores. The book is just 13x18 cms though it is hardcover as per listing and the page and print quality are good. Amazon delivered it in 5 days as usual.The book is really overhyped and though it makes for good one-time reading to discover all the hype around it, it is of little practical use, as the lifestyle of inhabitants of Okinawa is vastly different from urban living we are used to. Some of the activities Okinawans to, such as being physically active thru the day, eating a balanced diet, participating in community activities for shared interdependence, etc. can be practiced by city dwellers to some extent only. That the authors were too taken in by the lifestyle of Okinawans is evident from the detailed description of their daily habits, including several pages on exercise regimen like yoga (though some info is incorrect), Tai Chi, etc. which one can only learn by practicing oneself, not by reading in a book. The basic premise of the book may not apply to city folks as the lifestyle is that of folks who live on distant ldyllic places without the pressures of urban living. Okinawa can be one's dream destination to spend in one's sunset years, but very unlikely to inspire one to lead a similar lifestyle in the fast-paced metro / cities we live in.

R1UBTG8KT7NWOZ,Anukriti,"To be completely honest I bought this book just because of its cover. I mean just take a moment and observe it, the perfect shade of blue with white flowers. Simplicity at its best. This book has some sort of vibe, I still remember how I smiled when I opened the amazon parcel and found this bundle of positivity and happiness. The sheer pleasure of caressing its pages which is very different as compared to the regular pages of other novels, it gives you immense relief Idk how and why, but it does. Coming to the main content, the book starts by telling the meaning of Ikigai i.e.,purpose of your life, reason to get out of your bed every morning happily and how finding your Ikigai will lead to a long and happy life. The importance of society and a friendly neighbourhood is well put.The interviews of the Japanese Centenarians explains why they are the longest living human beings on this planet, they do the simple activities like gardening also with full enthusiasm, they arenâ€™t spending their retirement resting on an arm chair instead they attend Karaoke nights, indulge in group activities, sell their produce in vegetable market and believe in eating simple and exercising.They live in present and enjoy every moment happily. Because being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present and those who surround us.'ðŸ¦‹Our Ikigai is different for all of us but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. There is no perfect strategy of connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. Like the author said â€œLife is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love youâ€. The simplest things are often the most beautiful, and this book is the perfect example of this statement. ' Eat right, exercise, and do what makes you happy'...by following this motto, we can definitely find our 'ikagai', our reason to live.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 23 August 2020,The Best Things In Life Are Simple !,5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714nlI84ZKL.jpg,20

R3AJHN9P4AV7XC,Shilpa bhatia,"Ikigai came to me at a moment when I was feeling distracted and lost from my ultimate goal. Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I donâ€™t want to be one of these old women who canâ€™t rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too thatâ€™s why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb â€œOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred yearsâ€ and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.â€œNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eightâ€ is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying lifeâ€™s pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the â€˜wabi sabiâ€™ and â€˜ichi-go ichi-eâ€™ concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things  that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life. It is the reason to live â€˜ikigaiâ€™ and not anything else,  which keeps you going.

R3CCLLV5U2N1MJ,Vyoma Hadkar,"I started reading Ikigai, the book by Hector Garcia and Frances Mirales. It is a really short book but so profound when it comes to the real reason why Okinawans from Japan live the longest. They are called super centenarian. They eat about 18 varieties of food every day, the move a lot basically do a lot of gardening and walk and lot of community work, and drink a special kind of tea made from local fruit. They also do radio taiso exercise of basically five minutes. More importantly, the book talks about doing what you love to do. When you are one with your activity and your concentration is high that means you are in flow and very few people can do that - to maintain the flow is the challenge. It is basically all that you give to a given moment whether you do yoga, or look after a baby, cook for your family, nurture your plants... you are one with that moment and that if you repeatedly do, that gets you in flow. The book is full of interesting examples that keep you turning the page and in my case swiping left. I really enjoyed the book which is essentially about how to stay in the flow in the given moment and such a fun read.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 16 May 2020,Be one with god,4,,0

Japan is one of my favorite destinations and so this book was one of my must buy books. The author has given lots of information about the Centenarians, what they eat, how they work, the style they live and what keeps them so alive till the age of 100 years. It is so thrilling while reading this book, that anyone who is fond of Japanese people will love to read and follow their routine style. It has mentioned about the Yoga that is originated in India.

Best ones:- Never RETIRE.

To a person who believes that life is meant to be larger and not longer (like me) , this book might turn you off.

RXN84XXTUY3YS,Ankita2020,"This book is very different from the too technical ones already present out there on the same topic. Ikigai (book) was like a flow, exactly like the flow which it asks us to find in our lives. It is very crisp and to the point.It's talks about few things we already know but need to be reminded. Things we have learnt or heard of on the way of life, but all those needed to be collected in one place and this book is that place. We humans, in this current age, are running behind things without any meaningful outcome. But somewhere we had to be reminded that this is not what makes a happy life. And this is that reminder. Search for ikigai begins where the book ends.ðŸ™‚A quote from the book: ""Life is not a problem to be solved.

I found the title a bit unrelated to the content. The book starts with the ikigai concept but explores other areas of general well being and longevity.

R353MEFFMHYAY8,Short of a Century,"The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy.

RIM0DTZ8XK17B,SnoopyDa,"A cleverly marketed book with a catchy cover that opens your pocket easily...But having read it, i must say that the content and the treatment of the theme or subject is very shallow. For a naive reader the material may appear nice with a diverse variety of Japanese terms sprinkeled all over. References to a whole lot of thinkers, writers adds to the charm.But the whole plot falls apart when it leaves youbwanting for more. This book is like a buffet of tiny little dishes from multiple cuisines. You get to sample them but thats it.Some examples cited are also ridiculous, for instance, the authir says that for years after the 2011 Tsunami that devastated Japan, the market boomed for Japanese construction companies. That according to the author makes those companies ""anti-fragile"", meaning something that gets stronger when harmed.  I dont get it at all. The tsunami did no direct harm to the construction companies so one is unable to appreciate how they got stronger after the calamity.If an occasional sprinkle of terms like Wabi-Sabi, Ichi-go, Ichi-e, hari-hachi-bu, mabui, tai chi, qigong and so on excite you - pick it up.The book really leaves you craving for more, an experience like when you order a full meal but are served small portions as if it was a side dish.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 12 November 2019,Very shallow content,3,,1

I will be the last person to take those things by face value. Also, the book described the lifestyle of the centenarians as if they were living that way their whole life (singing, dancing, tending to their garden), which is simply not true.

The idea is to choose a career that qualifies on these 4 elements. I bought the book to explore more about this concept. But the book is not about the diagram, it is about general principles of a happy and long life that are practiced in a small town Okinawa in Japan. It is a good read but my expectation were a lot more. I later did some search and came across this link that says the the creator of the diagram is not even a Japanese and had only listened to a ted talk about IKIGAI. This is a weird world.

R32S02I08WP50C,Deven Sukhija,"Author and aspirant philosopher Hector Gracia was born in Spain. He has spent the past 18 years in Japan. Before moving to Japan, he was a software engineer in Switzerland. His most notable books are Ikigai, A Nerd in Japan, and Ichigo Ichie.Fiction, self-help, and inspirational works by award-winning author Francesc Miralles, who was also born in Spain. He concentrated on news-casting, English writing, and German. He has likewise filled in as a manager, interpreter, professional writer, and artist. His book Ikigai and Love in Lowercase made him famous.The creators of Ikigai have talked with many centenarians of Japan to unwind their mystery of being youthful and cheerful, at a late stage in life. The majority of Japanese lived on Okinawa, a Japanese island where 24 out of every 100,000 people are over 100 years old, significantly more than the global average. There are fewer diseases and longer lifespans among Okinawan women than anywhere else in the world. Lessons in the book are based on how these Japanese centenarians treat their work and their way of life, as well as what they eat and drink.The book presents the idea of ikigai and how it assists the Japanese nation with carrying on with a sound life late in the game. The authors then talk about how to prevent aging and how stress can harm our health. Case studies in which individuals discovered their purpose and concepts of logotherapy are discussed. Additionally, the fundamental tenets of Morita Therapy are discussed. The authors describe flow, the three steps that can be taken to achieve flow in the workplace, and how flow can help you discover your ikigai in the following chapter.The philosophy, routines, lifestyle, and diet of Japanese centenarians are discussed in the following chapters. Then the book makes sense of a few yoga and activities of Japanese individuals which keeps them solid. The idea of resilience and antifragility, which can help you deal with challenges in life without breaking down, is discussed in the final chapter. The ten ikigai rules are included in an epilogue at the book's conclusion.Three key examples which I have gained from the book is as per the following-(1)""Ikigai"" is a Japanese word that implies a justification behind living, an importance for living. Having a clear purpose that makes our lives worthwhile is called having an ikigai. Your ikigai is something you enjoy doing, such as sleeping, scrolling Instagram, or watching Netflix. won't count), you can be paid for, you are good at, and the world needs you. For instance, if you enjoy singing a lot and are skilled at it, singing is probably your ikigai. You can get paid to write good songs because the world needs them.Therefore, the first step is to identify your ikigai, or purpose, and then you should constantly act in order to achieve this goal. The good news is that this action will make you feel satisfied, so it won't be boring. You won't ever feel lost if you have an Ikigai, a clear goal.""He who has a for what reason to live for can endure with practically in any case.""-Viktor Frankl, an Austrian nervous system specialist(2)Work with the streamWe as a whole have encountered a circumstance in our lives where we forgot about time. It could have been when you were reading a book and got so absorbed in it that you didn't realize how quickly three hours passed. In any case, there are additionally times when the inverse occurs, and time doesn't elapse by any means. This probably happened to you during a dull lecture. What is causing this distinction? Why does time pass more slowly when we engage in activities that we find distasteful than when we engage in activities that we find interesting?The solution is flow. Ta-dah! Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist, coined the term flow and defined it as the pleasure we experience when we completely immerse ourselves in something. As per him,The state wherein individuals are so engaged with a movement that essentially nothing else appears to have any significance; Because it's so enjoyable, people will do it even if it costs a lot just for the thrill of it.At the point when we are in a condition of stream, we center around our work and not on interruptions. The power of center prompts Profound Work which builds our efficiency and simultaneously gives fulfillment. The work will be enjoyable once we find our flow.(3) Be resilient Being resilient was the most important lesson I took away from the book Ikigai. The capacity to withstand harm without becoming weakened is what is meant by resilience. It entails accepting everything that life throws at us without placing blame on others, without becoming frustrated, and without becoming discouraged.When you have a clearly defined ikigai, you must pursue it regardless of the difficulty. You can't surrender regardless of whether things are not going as per your assumption. Resilience's significance emerges at that point. Strength is our capacity to manage difficulties. We will be able to overcome challenges with greater ease if we have greater resilience. Resilient individuals are adept at overcoming challenges without becoming discouraged. They adjust to changes and focus just on those things which they can change.What impressed me most about Ikigai?First and foremost, I liked the idea of ikigai and the ways in which our ikigai can assist us in leading meaningful lives. This changes everything. The book's most beautiful chapter discussed the idea of flow and how to experience it in our work. I made notes about this idea because I liked it so much. Additionally, I enjoyed the section in which the authors discussed resilience and anti-fragility.The book made me realize how important it is to slow down, be in the moment, and be thankful for every little thing in my life. I was able to live peacefully, make friends, and enjoy every moment thanks to this book. I'm not sure; Because the book is like magic, I realized that there is nothing to worry about and only happiness to be had. It made me happy after I read it.What didn't I like about Ikigai?I anticipated, prior to reading the book, that it would assist me in discovering my own ikigai and purpose. However, when I read it, I found that it doesn't contain a lot of data about finding ikigai, which frustrated me. The book offers tips on how to exercise and eat more vegetables, both of which are somewhat commonplace and can be found in any blog. These were the few things about the book that I didn't like.Is it worth reading Ikigai?Indeed, the book Ikigai merits perusing since it contains numerous strong and demonstrated ideas which can assist you with working on your approach to everyday life. It can assist you in discovering your purpose and realizing the value of a purposeful life. In the present unpleasant and quick moving world, we seldom get any chance to recuperate our body, brain, and soul. You can gain a better understanding of the significance of slowing down and staying in the now by reading this book. Ikigai can assist you in having fun and losing yourself in your work if you're feeling bored in life. This book contains meetings of Japanese centenarians, which would propel you to carry on with a straightforward existence with high reasoning. All of the lessons were very useful, and anyone can easily put them into practice and see amazing results.Who ought to examine Ikigai?The book Ikigai is a must-read for anyone who is dissatisfied with their work and frustrated, who is overworked and stressed out at work and barely live their life, who lacks a purpose in life and feels lost, who is discouraged by failures, or any combination of the aforementioned. This book can also help people who don't live a healthy life, like those who smoke, drink, or eat junk food. Ikigai can cause anybody to figure out the significance of carrying on with an intentional life. Anyone who wants to live a long, fulfilled, and happy life can benefit from reading this book.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 4 May 2023,Ikigai,5,,0

It sounds like the book will help you find your ikigai, the reason for your being but the books simply points out that by finding your ikigai and doing it, you will live longer.May interesting interviews have been made part of the book but it still doesnot help finding ones purpose of life.

R3K6T4378RP3CH,PINKU PRADHAN,"""Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life"" is a book that explores the concept of ikigai, a Japanese term that roughly translates to ""a reason for being."" The authors, HÃ©ctor GarcÃ­a and Francesc Miralles, present a guide for discovering and nurturing one's ikigai, which they suggest can lead to a more fulfilling and contented life.The book begins by examining the history and cultural context of ikigai, tracing its origins to the island of Okinawa, where residents have among the longest lifespans in the world. The authors suggest that the pursuit of one's ikigai can lead to a sense of purpose and fulfillment that is linked to improved health and longevity.The book is divided into sections that explore different aspects of discovering one's ikigai, including identifying one's passions, discovering one's strengths and weaknesses, and finding ways to use one's skills and talents to benefit others. Throughout, the authors offer practical advice and exercises to help readers apply these concepts in their own lives.One of the strengths of the book is its focus on practicality. The authors provide concrete examples and exercises that readers can use to begin uncovering their own ikigai, and they encourage experimentation and exploration in the pursuit of a fulfilling life. The book is also well-written and engaging, with personal anecdotes and insights that make it an enjoyable read.However, some readers may find the book overly simplistic or superficial in its treatment of complex issues such as finding purpose and meaning in life. Additionally, some of the advice offered may not be applicable or relevant to all readers, depending on their individual circumstances.Overall, ""Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life"" is a well-written and engaging exploration of the concept of ikigai and its potential benefits for leading a fulfilling life. While some readers may find it overly simplistic or not entirely applicable to their own lives, others may find it a useful guide for uncovering their own sense of purpose and meaning.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 30 April 2023,Ikigai,4,,0

R3H8HN1OHAQZ6U,Niranjan J.,"Just peppering the word â€œikigaiâ€ throughout the book doesnâ€™t make the book about that. There is very little insight in here from essentially Japanese sources or culture, including those in setting the premise or explaining the concept.

R1VE34KI2CIY9P,Read with Taran,"Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means your 'reason for being. ' 'Iki' in Japanese means 'life,' and 'gai' describes value or worth.The book Ikigai is all about finding your life's purpose. It is about striking the balance between passion, profession, mission and vocation. This in turn leads to happiness and longevity. In many ways I felt the book reaffirms our learnings from Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning. Somehow, I felt the latter part of the book can be skipped as it is a jumble of things we come across in various other books. Even though the book in many places is redundant and repetitive, it has many nice takeaways from it.Of these I loved the Ten Rules of Ikigai which pretty much summarize the Ikigai way of life:â˜‘ï¸Stay active.â˜‘ï¸Don't retireâ˜‘ï¸Take it slowâ˜‘ï¸Get in shapeâ˜‘ï¸Live in the momentâ˜‘ï¸Reconnect with natureâ˜‘ï¸ Smileâ˜‘ï¸Surround yourself with good friendsâ˜‘ï¸Give thanksâ˜‘ï¸Follow your Ikigai",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 8 October 2022,Nice but goes astray from the objective,4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yP+ftOlbL.jpg,0

I am not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, however, while I did like idea of the book and the concept of Ikigai, I am not sure if I really found it as insightful as people claim it to be.  I also found a lack of connect while reading a few chapters and so I didn't really enjoy one this a lot. I do understand the appeal for this book and I think it could  just be my expectation for this book to be a lot more deeper and meaningful that left me disappointed in the end.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 21 November 2021,It is not really new information!,2,,0

R17T8S0M9PVZ8E,Khushi jha,"In the middle of me reading and enjoying this book, I recommended it to a cousin who's having doubts on herself in her new job, and some amount of anxieties about getting older. She replied with evident apathy, saying she'd had enough reading similar books, implying her doubt this book wouldn't be different. I have to admit there are many concepts, facts, and quotes we might have heard many times from consuming other sources before, but Miralles and Garcia offer invaluable new insights that stretch wide, that would inspire us to keep trying to be a better person, and eventually to live life to the fullest by having a purpose. A unique and real one that we've had since birth, that we're meant to discover if we haven't. Rather than becoming apathetic after my cousin's comment, I finished this book feeling really grateful for this book having found me, and getting even more convinced I won't stop reading self-help and inspiring books, because everyone needs a reminder every now and then anyway.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 9 August 2022,The most important book to actually know to live a healthy and happy life.,5,,0

R2AVK76NE7DQG7,R RAM MOHAN,"This book is the result of the authors' attempt to unlock the secrets of the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese , especially in the island of Okinawa , where you can find 24.55 centenarians per 100,000 inhabitants , far above the global average . The authors feel that such longevity cannot be explained only by  a healthy diet , a simple life in the open ,green tea and the sub-tropical climate. According to them , it is the Japanese term , ikigai , roughly translated as the happiness of always being busy  or a reason to jump out of bed early morning , which may be specific to each individual  that has contributed to such a long life , mostly free from chronic and debilitating diseases so common in advanced age elsewhere. When they explore the concept further with the centenarians through interviews and participation in their daily lives , they come across other traits arising from their ikigai , viz going with the flow , focus on the present , prioritization, staying active beyond retirement , enjoying mundane tasks , resilience or ' anti-fragility ' ( getting stronger when harmed ) while facing the misfortunes of life etc. In addition , their lifestyle involving a fruit and vegetable diet along with fish , low sugar and salt intake , lot of walking or moving , an active social and community life ,gardening , regular calisthenics - all these contribute to a happy and long life.

R2NVPZGOKTX9SE,Neil,"I have always wondered about the Japanese spirit of resilience and rebirth. How do they live so long? How are they so productive to the end of their days? How do they have such excellent physiques? Most importantly, what gives them the tenacity to never give up even in the face of the most extreme odds (the aftermath of the WW2 being an example, out of which the Japanese only came out stronger)?The answer is in this book, and it is Ikigai.Ikigai doesn't just preach; it peppers itself with several examples and anecdotes, including tips from the supercentenarians of the world (those who have lived beyond 110 years). It gives thorough advice on enriching various aspects of life.I strongly recommend this book to all of us who are still looking for meaning in our lives, who feel that life is out to get them at every moment, who are, simply, too overwhelmed by everything that's going on around. Do pause awhile, and immerse yourself in this world of Ikigai and you'll come out richer.And, since I heard the audiobook on Audible, I'd put a word of recommendation for that too.

R3RLXMKR5V5QQD,devanshi,"Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning.â€â€• Hector Garcia PuigcerverThe word 'IKIGAI' is a Japanese concept which means ""a reason for being"". It refers that one must have a purpose in life which will make their life worthwhile, and for this one must take some willing actions to feel satisfied and have some meaning to life.This book mainly tells that every single person has their own ikigai. Every person finds an ikigai at a certain point of life. Our ikigai is different from others and is hidden deep inside us. Once a person discovers his or her ikigai, it brings meaning to their lives. It is not like that a person has no meaning of living. The books  notifies various methods using which a person can find their purpose in life. A person can find their purpose by doing different activities till they don't feel cheerful and pleased doing it.So far as liking this book, it was good. It had some motivational lessons to improve our lives. Also had some ways following which one could refine lives.

RNK6653OTOLOS,Tanya,"Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to long and happy life.The book touches various aspects of life which can help us achieve a long and better life. Basically, it beautifully explains the deep art of staying young while growing old. Various real-life examples are cited, especially with reference to Okinawa, a Japanese island inhabiting people with higher life expectancy.It is quite evident that the authors stress more on discovering the meaning of life rather than creating one for you. Most importantly, the book helps us in finding the meaning of being in the 'flow' and how to achieve the 'flow'.The book concludes after introducing another Japanese Technique called â€” Wabi-Sabi - finding beauty in imperfect, incomplete things. Here flawed is preferred over perfection. Japanese believe that only imperfect, incomplete and ephemeral things are beautiful because they resemble the nature.To conclude, I think the book reading experience was as beautiful as the book cover.

They combined term ikigai make it as ""meaning or purpose"".â—¾Essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.â—¾Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning.â—¾Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.â—¾Life is not a problem to be solved.â—¾Walk slowly and youâ€™ll go far. When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.â—¾A positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness are the keys for longevity.â—¾Our ability to turn routine tasks into moments of micro flow, into something we enjoy, is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.â—¾Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their environment, and be free of distractions. â—¾There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you donâ€™t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to discover it.â—¾ Resilience and Wabi-Sabi: To face life's challenges without letting stress and worry age you. â—¾Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us connect with our ikigai.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 20 July 2021,Read once for a life time experience!!,5,,0

When we live urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.(3) Don't fill your stomach: Follow the 80 percent rule(4) Surround yourself with good friends(5) Get in shape for your next birthday(6) Smile(7) Reconnect with nature(8) Give thanks(9) Live in the moment(10) Follow your ikigaiThe author says â€“ Ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning.

Once in this state, you work at your best, and experience bliss.  In the state of flow you dont experience ay resistance whatsoever and hence you experience an eternity and the desire for immortality for contemplative minds like mind could be a natural result!the book speaks about the researched lives and way of living of the largest number of centenarians in the world---ie. in Japan. What they eat, how they live everyday, the way they think, how they live minimalistic lives and sink into a state of flow in their pursuits, foods they refrain from and spiritual practices they practise daily.Powerful book for people wanting to simplify their lives! Please go ahead and buy the boy! It isn't the usual kind of self-help books that you would wish to push aside.

R3QKN37CMHC9F4,IAS SHIVAM CHITRANSH,"I recently completed reading a very inspiring book â€” IKIGAI â€” The Japanese Secret to a Long Happy Life. The book is authored by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles. In this article, I am going to talk about my learning from the book.The book touches the various aspects of life which can help us achieve a long happy life. It is based on ancient, well practised Japanese technique called â€” IKIGAI.If you google the word, you will get various meanings like-A reason for being, encompassing joy, a sense of purpose and meaning and a feeling of well-beingORThe word derives from iki, meaning life and kai, meaning the realisation of hopes and expectations.But the one I liked the most is â€”A reason to jump out of bed each morning!This book draws a lot of references from an island in Japan called â€” Okinawa where there 24.5 inhabitants of age more 100 for every 1,00,000 people.book explains how stress, a lot sitting adds up to your age and makes reduces your life duration. Interesting it also mentions very prominently that little stress is good for you since it keeps you going. I firmly believe â€” Being Conscious of Your Daily Routine Can Lead to A Better Life!it helps you deep dive into discovering the meaning of your life. It is quite evident that the authors stress more on discovering the meaning of life rather than creating one for you!This part is my most favourite where the authors helps you find the meaning of being in the flow. If you have discovered the meaning of your life, you need to completely immerse into the experience without being distracted by the surroundings and you attain the flow.There are several more techniques like wabi sabi..This techniques talks about finding beauty in imperfect, incomplete things. Here flawed is preferred over perfection. Japanese believe that only imperfect, incomplete and ephemeral things are beautiful because they resemble the nature.To conclude, I think the book is extremely inspiring and full of content. I could attain my flow while reading it. Loved it ! Highly recommended reading â€” You can buy the book on Amazon!Hope it was helpful.Thanks for reading.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 5 May 2020,A must read for becoming progressive like Japan.,5,,1

R21HES38MRS452,Shalini veigas,"Quote from the book:""Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.""Food for thought:The first thought that pops up in a conversation regarding this book is the title. Ikigai translates into an abstract form of expression unbound by ""the happiness of always being busy.""The concept and philosophy of longevity are drawn from the Okinawa tribe in Japan. The fact that the majority number of centenarians hails from their humble abode leaves one confounded. The Village of Longevity, as it's rightly called, has its allure in its simple living and minimalistic instincts.As we embark upon the mission to find our ikigai, there are snippets of facts that can hold one's attention far longer than one would expect from a self-help book. The interwoven display of our very own being is primary and easy to understand.It is a book like no other! You will be exercising not only your mind and body but also your spirit.Ikigai has redefined my consciousness and revealed the pure bliss of living. Let not fear crinkle your eyes or stress wrinkle your foreheads. The true spirit of the book is in its lucid language and beautiful analogies.There is a sense of calm and acceptance that flows throughout the book. Holistic living and mindfulness are essential for making conscious decisions. Prudent choices leave an impact more prominent than any force trying to shape our tomorrow.Disclaimer:It will anchor your thoughts and ground your feelings.My favorite part of the book is anecdotes from the people who live to be 110 years of age or more. I was stumped by the stories and couldn't believe it at first glance. The proof was right there in their recounted tales as I kept gaping at the pages in disbelief.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 28 July 2020,A pleasant surprise!,5,,0

RXKBRW1ZWQIGN,KG,"I had high hopes from this book given the hype. But it is just a loose collection of common wisdom, like keep working, do light exercises daily, make friends, tend to a vegetable garden, live in present, eat lightly and so on.It does not tell anything about the life of people of Okinawa other that how are they living today, when they are in 80ies, 90ies of 100+. What I was hoping to find is how they lived their youth and middle age life. How did they live without worries of the world during the prime of their careers.Authors used lot of content from others to assemble this book.Two stars for the good advice which are common sense and pretty much known but as a reminder for use on how to live our lives.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 22 October 2022,Disappointing,2,,0

R2N3I4Q3WR85N1,Aditya,"""Ikigai"" is a wonderful book that delves into the Japanese concept of ""ikigai,"" which translates to ""the reason for being."" The authors, Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles, do an excellent job of exploring the history and philosophy behind ikigai, and provide practical tips for readers to find their own ikigai.The book is divided into several chapters, each of which explores a different aspect of ikigai. The authors cover topics such as mindfulness, purpose, passion, and community, and provide numerous examples of how people have found their ikigai in various ways.One of the strengths of ""Ikigai"" is its accessibility. The authors write in a clear, concise style that is easy to understand, and they provide plenty of anecdotes and examples to illustrate their points. Additionally, the book is visually appealing, with beautiful illustrations and photographs throughout.Overall, I highly recommend ""Ikigai"" to anyone interested in exploring the concept of ikigai and finding more purpose and happiness in their lives. The book is well-written, informative, and inspiring, and is sure to leave readers feeling motivated to discover their own reason for being.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 4 May 2023,"Discover your ""ikigai"" - the reason for being - with this insightful and beautifully designed book.",4,,0

R3DFM2U9KUA15V,Tanu,"ðŸ’ŒFavourite line: ""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsâ€”to choose oneâ€™s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose oneâ€™s own way.""..ðŸ“– In this book, the term ikigai is translated as the bliss of always being busy. Ikigai is actually a combination of your passion, your mission and your profession. this book answers some basic questions as to why some people tirelessly keep doing what they have been doing for years tirelessly even though it's the same things over and over again, say, actors, writers, bloggers, artists and so on. Why do some people never get bored or frustrated repeating doing the same things over and over again?â›„Now I know this book is overhyped in the market and a lot of us have too high expectation from it. While I think the book is more about answering the basic question which we most of the time overlook. Also, it provides a ten-point compressed rule of ikigai:Stay active; donâ€™t retire.Take it slow.Donâ€™t fill your stomach.Surround yourself with good friends.Get in shape for your next birthday.SmileReconnect with nature.Give thanks.Live in the moment.Follow your ikigai...âœ¨Overall, this book is truly uplifting. The reader is intrigued by the simplicity and calming tone it offers, and it captures the attention of the reader till the end.

But then I began it again, this time along with an Audiobook which helped me complete the book easily and that was my first audiobook experience as well.Now back to the book, in further chapters it talks less about your passion and more about, importantly, a calmer and peaceful way of life. It talks about taking it slow, eating right, rejoicing with good friends, excercise, smile, being grateful and reconnecting to nature.

R113DZF3HJ3SQ8,Sid,"Review IkigaiIkigai, a book that was on my list for long, I got an audio book as I was not getting much time to sit and read, well it was very nice to listen it through. I might have enjoyed more reading it but I had to complete it as it was stacking on my list from many months. I would suggest the audio book for those who have a keen hearing sense and not multi task while listening.About the book, it is too hard to write something about Ikigai, but it sure teaches are a lot of things and tells us of many interesting facts. The place in Okinawa which is called the place of Longevity, the people and their typical style of living, something that impressed me the most. Well, the whole book is worth reading, and learning from.There are certainly few things that are easy to follow, like the 80% eating habit, walk in the nature, no Tech days, walking â€“ keep moving, friends, smiling and having a hobby that keeps you busy otherwise. In all those we can always find our Ikigai, once we find one, just follow the flow. I do not mean to say that oneâ€™s Ikigai is one among these but with these you can always get inside your self to find what is it, for you.TH 10 principles towards the end of the book are really helpful and easy to understand and not very easy to follow thou. What I really want to try is the White Tea thou. Another interesting thing is the village in Okinava where the youngest man, was about 83 years old, most of the people are around 100. Some of the inputs from the people who lived more than 100 were good to hear, not sure if it is so easy to follow though.On the whole a wonderful book, and I sure will read this book some other time and see what is that I can adopt, if not for longevity but for piece of mind which is much needed for everyone in todayâ€™s techno-busy world.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 26 November 2022,Ikigai... a beautiful book to read,5,,0

R21JF73S5KREI6,Angeles christanova,"As a starter, I was being introduced to this book by a professor pro, I was meant to write a report after going through it.  I wish to give this book 5 star however, there are a lot of questionable research that unless I had a profound study into it, or I probably will not know if it is legit or false information. There are many contradictory upon the ideas. Some of them are actually repackaging. I do wish this book is more concentrated and focus upon the topic , however, even the author doesnâ€™t seems to be research thoroughly. Of course, I did conclude the fact that publishing guide line requires the book to have a set an amount of writings. which is why they probably have to include so many things that are not related to the topic.  However, there are so many key points, interesting / inspiring stories, even good examples yet I felt that they did not research enough.

R1GSLM85230V8N,"Gary Moreau, Author","The rather exotic sounding name of this book, ikigai, as the authors explain, is relatively straightforward. â€œThis Japanese concept, which translates roughly as â€œthe happiness of always being busy,â€ is, â€œlike logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond.â€ Logotherapy, they explain, â€œâ€¦helps people find their purpose in life.â€It is a good book. My overall rating of the book has little to do with the quality of the writing or the underlying concept. The former is quite good and the latter is valid. My rating is strictly personal and relates more to who might be considering adding it to their reading list. Not a â€œdonâ€™t,â€ for sure. More like, â€œunderstand it for what it is.â€For those who are ardent fans of all things philosophical and psychological, as I am, this is a good book that plows relatively little new ground. Finding purpose in life, keeping busy, eating well, and finding connection to the world around you is important. Itâ€™s ground, however, that has been covered by many authors over the years.If you havenâ€™t sampled of these past triumphs you will enjoy this book very much. It is a great and easily read introduction to the topics of longevity and the benefits of living in the moment. And it chronicles many of the philosophies and prior contributions to the topic, from Buddhism to Stoicism, with a stop at the Serenity Prayer. Eastern, and particularly Japanese, contributions are given extra attention. Wabi-sabi and ichi-go ischi-e, for example, are explained in some detail, but remain an overview. Relatively newer concepts like antifragility are also explained. It even covers the Six Healing Sounds introduced by Sun Simiao in the sixth century. (This one was new to me.)A lot of the book turns on Ogimi, in the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, which holds the distinction of being the oldest village on the planet. (In that many of the residents have lived very long lives.) Itâ€™s a delightful visit. Having lived in China for nine years and having visited Japan many times over the course of more than three decades, I have a deep fondness for places like Ogimi. Iâ€™m not sure, however, that they arenâ€™t byproducts of the totality of Japanese culture. Could they take seed in places like California or Virginia, for example?Part of my ikigai is to be a nice person and not think disparagingly of anyone. And I am not here. This book was an interesting read for me, and may be a revelational read for you. I make no judgment on that. I just give you my experience as a reader.This book would, in my opinion, make an excellent gift for anyone in your life that might need a little boost or is otherwise hard to buy for. There is absolutely nothing here that could meet with controversy or resistance.

Smile, do light exercise, walk a little daily, eat well, enjoy herbal tea and smile as a part of a community. While this book might present the 'knowns' of what it takes to be happy it weaves in a philosophy of serenity to the chaos that is daily life for most people in the west. It shows us we can be happy in finding our own purpose in life and that living our own ikigai we can have a wholesome existence fulfilling human nature in combination with our own desires.I gave this book four stars simply because I think something is missing, something that addresses those big existential questions I always have trouble understanding. Who we are, where we come from and why we're here in the first place.While I didn't find my own Ikigai by reading this book it did help me realise I need to find it.

I found some sections of the book more meaningful than others, with a couple seeming a bit superficial, but this was probably more to do with the subject I had already read.I think if you new to philosophy and in particular Eastern philosophy this book is a fantastic first step, if you are a practicing some of the concepts in the book already you may find some of the detail a bit light.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 28 October 2020,A simple guide toward purpose!,4,,1

Yes there are chapters on diet and exercise, and the content of these is not particularly new or surprising (however irritating it may be, these things are indeed features of a healthy lifestyle).But there is a good deal more, including the sense of purpose and meaning that is common to those who have lived to an advanced age. The way this is explored and its links to, for example, logotherapy, are helpful and illuminating. Ikigai offers a genuine recipe for living a meaningful life if you are prepared to give it some time and thought.I strongly disagree with the reviewer who wanted it to be much longer!

R3JWG2N9UF9H0G,Juriy Bura,"If you've read Freakonomics, you'll see why.When talking about life expectancy authors rely heavily on interviews with long-living individuals to deduct the factors that contribute to their ability to live long. This is simply irrelevant. If you ask an average tall person, why they are tall, they would not be able to answer, and their ideas and intuition would be as good as yours.Authors have a very noble goal of finding the factors that increase one's life expectancy, but they do so without use of statistical analysis and or scientific methods often leading to humorous contradictions.Here's one example: ""during last 100 years, life expectancy increased in average 0.3 years per year"". ""Cavemen had much less stress than modern humans, since volumes of information and devices are contributing to the stress"". But why is then life expectancy growing proportionally to the development of media then? Maybe this informational stress *positively* correlates with life expectancy? Without proper research it is impossible to tell if values are correlated and if they have any reason-cause relations.I liked a chapter about author's experience in Ogimi in Okinawa was nevertheless very good. Not because the insights were valuable, but because of a vivid image of traditional Japan that authors have conveyed. This is the most authentic chapter and it deserves a separate book. I would read that book, not this one.Authors jump between subjects of mental health, having purpose in life, diet and exercise, compiling and reciting many other great books. From this perspective, the book was very valuable, since I learned about works of Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Viktor Frankl. I already knew about Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and planned to read his book ""Flow"".Doing my own research on what authors have briefly mentioned I discovered several other areas of knowledge that I want to learn more about. This was the biggest value of this book.Lastly, authors start to jump over myriad of loosely-related subjects: diet and nutritions, meditation, spiritual practices, yoga, tai chi, and it all in just few words. Pictures of Tai Chi exercises together with the descriptive text looked like a waste of space in an already tiny book.I would not recommend to read the book, but instead read all the other books that this book borrowed ideas from.",Reviewed in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on 28 October 2020,"Marvellous print quality, very shallow content",2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nwwMIp4WL.jpg,44

Also this book is not exactly about how you can find your Ikigai; however, it offers various tips to find your own flow and ways to maintaining it. It has also explained contributing factors in longevity. On and all it was blissful read.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 17 April 2020,Blissful read!,5,,0
R36X9MQ9SXDRTC,Dustin Caleb,"The authors seem to imply that a long, healthy life is synonymous with Ikigai; multiple chapters are spent discussing how to achieve a long, healthy life by lowering your stress, eating healthy, exercising, having meaningful relationships, ect. - things that are generally common sense. While these things are obviously important and can influence your ability to find your ikigai and remain in a peaceful state, I don't believe long life is synonymous with ikigai; the former is focused on longevity and the second on purpose. Furthermore, I would have liked more material that would actually guide readers towards thier ikigais instead of high-level overviews. The author ends with essentially saying to just follow your interests (while being healthy) and to not worry too much about finding your ikigai; I suppose the authors were suggesting to appreciate the journey rather than being fixated on the destination. Criticisms aside, there were a few good reminders in the book, and it was a short read, so I think reading this book was still a positive use of my time.",Reviewed in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ on 5 February 2021,"Was expecting more, but still beneficial",3,,3

RNZ90LPSTF727,Daryn,"I loved the concept of IKIGAI when I first saw the diagram, and bought this book because I imagined it would help me through the process of mapping out and defining my IKIGAI. A kind of step-by-step guide to discovering my IKIGAI. It isn't that. About halfway through the book I realised it wasn't going to provide that level of insight and 'instruction', and initially felt disappointed. I stopped reading and decided to re-read the book for what it is, rather than from the perspective of what I expected it to be, and I discovered a wonderful book I definitely recommend for other seekers.It's filled with some great insights, brief introductions to other great philosophies, and a high-level overview of the 'territory' that includes IKIGAI. If you're looking for a detailed map with precise instructions on how to go from 'here' to 'there', this book is not going to be that for you. It is, instead, a very broad guide that points in the general direction of IKIGAI, and gives you some other IKIGAI-related nuggets of wisdom for consideration and inspiration.If you're feeling something tugging inside of you, this is a great place to start. If you're being pulled strongly in a specific direction and are seeking a comprehensive guide through the mist, this book may frustrate you rather than help you.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 17 January 2018,"Not what I 'expected' but once I accepted it for what it is, I really enjoyed the book.",5,,7
R1HTRWCT4HSAKD,CC,"Anyone interested in taking steps toward living a long and healthy life has probably already read, heard, or surmised 95% of the tips offered in this book. But the 5% that makes the difference is the part where the Ikigai comes in. Here in the west we all hear about how stress is killing us, and weâ€™re inundated with practices and techniques to alleviate it. Weâ€™re encouraged to be â€œmindfulâ€ but not much is forthcoming about how to be happy. And we donâ€™t hear so much about purpose or finding our reason to live (Ikigai). I think anyone who is not clinically depressed or on the brink of suicide would say â€œyesâ€ if asked, â€œWould you want to live to 110 years of age in perfect health, in a state of joy, with no need for assistance with any physical or mental task?â€ And in this book, there are scores of interviews with people doing exactly that. Ikigai shines the spotlight on the habits, approach to, and outlook on life that are most likely responsible for not just the longevity but the vigorous and joyful longevity of the people of Okinawa - lives filled with self-sufficiency, movement, gratitude, love, peace, and antifragility.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 17 March 2019,A Little Gem of a Book,5,,54

R1MZCQOPUWR0TX,Adler Scout,"I really enjoy the simple and easy reading, as if I was reading the authors journals from their search about Ikigai.And this is such an important theme and I'd suggest everyone should read about it or be more conscious about it, specially if you aren't living your passion. On a side note, this goes beyond having a passion in life (something we really enjoy doing) to how we can appreciate more life.However, this books feels like a collection of notes and topics at a very surface level. This topic is important but sometimes I wish there would be a place in publishing for articles, blog posts, or concepts that could be explained in a few pages. I liked reading this book but I feel it just doesn't deliver and let's me wonder which book should I actually read if I'd like to read more about the mix of topics it talks about. The book tries to be too many things and in the end is very shallow.And if I talk about longevity, then it's really weak. At minimum anecdotical as the lists and recommendations are just weakly researched and elaborated. It's probably a good overview but not more than that. Perhaps I should read the book about the blue zones.As the authors seem to be great at writing, as I said the text is easy and engaging to read, I wished they had focused more on one topic and delivered something more substantial.It's an OK book to introduce people on the topics around ikigai. I wouldn't say the same about longevity. A lot is common sense, just the majority doesn't do it. A lot is contextual, for instance, we know that community living is important and beneficial. However, our city life development and moving to other cities makes this more and more difficult. Not to mention the demands on today's jobs and their working hours.Despite all this, it's an inspirational book and I do hope it inspires many people to find their Ikigai and create a more community living setup around them.",Reviewed in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on 17 November 2017,Lovely theme to dive in but too generic in the this book,2,,8

Some parts, for example the quick intro to yoga and taichi, felt like they were shoehorned in to fill space and offered little more info that what you might find on a Wikipedia page. I would have liked to hear more from the residents of this blue zone. All in all, it felt a little gimmicky, like it was hopping on the blue zone bandwagon that is currently all the rage.

R3KD5DMPD7S3L,Myriam Schorn,"Leaning heavily on Dan Buettnerâ€™s Blue Zones, this book presents the 101 of longevity beyond Ikigai. It dabbles into nutrition, where it even mentions Dr Mosleyâ€™s 5:2 diet (and claims fasting â€œhelps cleanse the digestive systemâ€ - a notion that probably would make Valter Longo cringe) and professes benefits of melatonin produced at sleep that arenâ€™t the main health benefit of sleep (please read Prof Walker for that).In short: this book has no direction, is imprecise on the science and would have been better if it had staid focussed on Ikigai. The excursions into Japanese spirituality and logotherapy I found interesting - and probably less offensive as I have never read anything about these topics before.Rarely has a book made me so angry.

R3NEXN2L1FYJSM,erna,"I am a non-Japanese person who has lived in Japan for over 3 years, and was interested in this mystical concept of ""ikigai"". So, I thought I would start with this well-reviewed book.Despite it's title and introduction, this book touches very little on ikigai, and instead focuses on ""how to live a long time"" based on poorly researched information (the Daily Mirror said fruits are healthy, who knew!!!) and random, biased accounts of different forms of therapy, asian philosophy, and even *Chinese* tai-chi. The authors had the rare opportunity to gain insight into the lives of the Okinawan centenarians, but sadly only came away with little more than a few quotes about how much the elders love to garden and hang out with their friends.After reading this book, I thought I ask a real Japanese about ikigai, so I asked a native friend. I was told it is basically a lifelong hobby, passion, or profession. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble, but this is just another poorly researched and biased piece of literature romanticizing asian and ""eastern"" cultures and won't really provide you with constructive information.",Reviewed in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ on 5 May 2020,Not actually about ikigai,1,,42

Spoiler alert, it basically says eat less, exercise a bit and have loads of friends. I already knew that and could have saved myself a bit of money. It also implies scientists are wrong about aging ( and implies the author thinks we are only a few decades away from being able to live for ever, despite some sad but pretty heavy weight scientific evidence to the contrary). It is written in a very patronising style as if the author thinks the reader is 5 years old and does the usual thing of preaching that the author knows best and that if their life style doesnâ€™t fit with yours then you are the one thatâ€™s wrong. Iâ€™ve never been a fan of â€œself helpâ€ books but after the rave reviews I thought iâ€™d give this one a go. I think I know who it helped, or rather whoâ€™s bank balance it helped, and itâ€™s not me. Put simply, if you have a bad lifestyle you are likely to have a shorter life than someone who exercises all the time, doesnâ€™t drink, doesnâ€™t really understand ( or want to understand ) how the universe works, gives their money away, doesnâ€™t care about possessions, and eats lots of vegetables.

RN2L1U3MWTXI4,A. R. Jones,Ikigai remains a â€˜Japanese secretâ€™ having read this book. Not that I was expecting â€˜the answerâ€™ but was expecting more of an analysis than drawing on occidental studies mostly from psychology to understanding a deeply oriental way of being. The book is most interesting when the voices of those living the ikigai life is present and less so in the other 75% of the book which is largely the authors â€œexplainingâ€ things through a very narrow lens.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 17 November 2018,Disappointing: a glossy magazine attempt at understanding Ikigai,2,,45

R1C4PEYGHR6ZVY,Anirban Das,"Talking about personal finances is often avoided despite its importance in our lives. Over the years, our have value systems have ingrained in our minds that thinking about money is equivalent to being greedy which is far from the truth. It is high time we overcome misconceptions and understand the importance of growing or at the very least (literally) maintaining the value of money we have as it is virtually impossible for anyone to work throughout their lives for money after a certain age.For those who are willing to take steps towards understanding the importance of money and personal finance, Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki is one of the books, I would recommend to start with. Written in a language that can be understood without any prior knowledge of finance, the book very systematically explains the importance of ""financial Intelligence"" and getting out of the ""rat race"" by making money work for us instead of the other way round. Although the concepts are based on the author's own life experiences which predominantly includes investments in the real estate sector, they are quite universal.Out of the many arguments put forth in the book which I mostly agree with, the most important one as per me is that 'financial education starts at home' as it shapes the mindset of an individual for lifetime. Luckily, mine started at an early age during dinner table talks with my dad.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 18 February 2022,Must Read,5,,1

RHXT9091Z8FF8,Byreddy Trinadh Reddy,"â€œRich dad poor dad is one of the most popular self-helpbooks ever written. It was written by Robert Kiyosaki awell-renowned investor, to let the world know how theycan gain finical knowledge and live a life withoutworrying about money. This book is best for beginnerswho want to attain finical freedomâ€",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 7 July 2022,Rich Dad Poor Dad,4,,0
R1H5ICBXFH42AP,Amazon Customer,"""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" by Robert T. Kiyosaki is a thought-provoking and eye-opening book that challenges conventional wisdom about wealth and financial success. Through the lens of his own upbringing, Kiyosaki shares the contrasting perspectives of his two fathersâ€”one rich and one poorâ€”and imparts invaluable lessons on how to build wealth and achieve financial independence.One of the book's greatest strengths is Kiyosaki's ability to simplify complex financial concepts, making them accessible to readers from all walks of life. He emphasizes the importance of financial literacy, urging individuals to develop a deep understanding of money, assets, liabilities, and cash flow. By breaking down these fundamental concepts, Kiyosaki empowers readers to rethink their approach to money management and take control of their financial future.The book's core message revolves around the power of financial education and the importance of adopting a mindset that embraces opportunities for wealth creation. Kiyosaki challenges the traditional notion of ""go to school, get good grades, and find a secure job"" by emphasizing the need to build assets and generate passive income. He advocates for thinking like an entrepreneur, exploring investments, and developing multiple streams of income.While ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" provides valuable insights and practical advice, it must be approached with a critical mindset. Some readers may find certain anecdotes and examples oversimplified or overly focused on real estate investing. Additionally, the book's emphasis on financial independence and wealth creation may not resonate with everyone, as individual circumstances and goals vary.Nonetheless, the book serves as an important catalyst for shifting one's mindset and challenging traditional beliefs about money. Kiyosaki's engaging writing style and personal anecdotes make for an enjoyable read, and his passion for financial education shines through every chapter.In conclusion, ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" is an empowering and influential book that encourages readers to think differently about money and take charge of their financial destiny. It serves as a valuable starting point for those seeking to develop their financial literacy and embark on a journey towards financial independence. However, readers should approach the book as a springboard for further exploration and adapt the principles to their unique circumstances and goals.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 1 May 2023,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",5,,0

It might have worked for him but may not work for everyone else. Again, having said that he also presses on investing in financial education and seems (I might be contradicting myself here) if one has that knowledge, an individual can find a way out even with investment in real estates or some other avenues.All in all, a must-read and a recommended reread as well.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 13 May 2021,Important learnings,5,,0

The author, Robert Kiyosaki, brilliantly compares the financial mindset of his two dads, his biological father who was highly educated but struggled financially, and his best friend's father who was a self-made millionaire.One of the most powerful takeaways from this book is the concept of ""financial education."" Kiyosaki emphasizes the importance of learning about money and investing in order to achieve financial freedom. He writes, ""The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth in what seems to be an instant.""Another key lesson from Rich Dad Poor Dad is the idea of ""paying yourself first."" Kiyosaki encourages readers to prioritize saving and investing, even if it means sacrificing some luxuries in the short term. He writes, ""The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them.""Kiyosaki's writing style is engaging, straightforward, and easy to understand, making this book accessible to readers of all backgrounds and financial knowledge levels. I found myself highlighting and taking notes on nearly every page, as there is so much valuable information packed into this book.In short, Rich Dad Poor Dad is a life-changing book that I highly recommend to anyone seeking financial freedom and a better understanding of money and investing. If you're looking to transform your financial future and build lasting wealth, this book is a must-read!",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 28 April 2023,"Life-Changing Book! A Must-Read for Anyone Seeking Financial Freedom, Wealth, and Prosperity!",5,,1
RVZ3K5BW1BU6R,Jacob H,"Are you tired of living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to make ends meet? ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki is the personal finance book you need to read. This book challenges traditional ideas about wealth and financial success, telling the story of Kiyosaki's two fathers - one who was financially struggling, and one who was a wealthy entrepreneur.With ten chapters filled with practical advice and lessons, ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" covers everything from understanding assets and liabilities to the importance of financial education and taking calculated risks. But what sets this book apart is its focus on mindset and attitude towards money. Kiyosaki encourages readers to challenge their preconceived notions about wealth and to adopt a more entrepreneurial approach to finances.But don't let the financial jargon intimidate you - this book is engaging and easy to read. Kiyosaki weaves personal anecdotes throughout the narrative, making the book relatable to readers of all ages and backgrounds. And with his passion for financial education shining through every page, you can't help but feel inspired to take control of your financial future.Of course, no book is perfect. Some readers may find that the advice is oversimplified or overly optimistic. But the book's overall message of empowerment and financial education is one that every reader can take to heart.In short, ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is an insightful and inspiring book that challenges readers to rethink their attitudes towards money and wealth. With its practical advice and emphasis on mindset, this book is a must-read for anyone looking to take control of their financial future.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 25 April 2023,Good book to get you inspired but could lead you to make some risky financial decisions,4,,2
R2GSS9AXYSCMNO,Josh A,"Rich Dad Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki is a groundbreaking book that challenges traditional thinking about wealth and financial education. The book is based on Kiyosaki's personal experience growing up with two dads - his biological father, who was highly educated but struggled financially, and his best friend's father, who had no formal education but was incredibly wealthy.Throughout the book, Kiyosaki compares and contrasts the financial habits and philosophies of these two men, highlighting the differences between their mindsets and the impact that those mindsets had on their financial success.One of the most powerful ideas presented in ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is the importance of financial education. Kiyosaki argues that the traditional education system does not provide adequate training in financial literacy and that many people are held back by their lack of understanding of basic financial concepts.The book also emphasizes the importance of taking control of your finances and investing in assets that generate passive income. Kiyosaki encourages readers to think outside the box and consider alternative forms of income, such as rental properties or small businesses.Overall, ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" is a highly insightful and thought-provoking book that challenges readers to think differently about wealth and financial success. While some of Kiyosaki's ideas may be controversial or difficult to implement, the book provides a valuable starting point for anyone looking to take control of their finances and build a more secure financial future.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 20 March 2023,Life Improving Book,5,,6

R3763H9VZAZY8,Kevin Choi,"I am not a person who reads books. I recently started to think about ways to invest or open my own business to get financial independence. Heard about the book a million times but never got interested enough to pick one up. Video interviews of Robert Kiyosaki started to  appear every now and then and he started to poke my interest.Finally decided to try to see what the fuzz was about the book and bought it. From the start the book caught my interest, I found myself reading everyday and actually enjoying it, again I do not like to or do not have the habit of reading books so for me it is a big deal.I finished the book and learned a lot from it. I say it is the best cheap investment because I bought it for less than $10.00 dollars and what I learned from the book is worth much more. Looking forward to reading the next books in his series and perhaps exploring other authors that can expand my financial literacy as well.I recommend this book for anyone who has no idea on how or where to start getting some financial education and inspiration. It is a short and easy to understand book and maybe like it did with me, it will be a gateway to get you to finally do something about investing in your knowledge for financial independence.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 6 January 2023,Best cheap investment,5,,29

Kiyosaki shares his personal story of growing up with two dads - one who was financially successful and the other who struggled financially. Through this personal anecdote, he highlights the differences in mindset and habits between the rich and the poor.The advice given in the book is practical and actionable. Kiyosaki stresses the importance of financial education, investing, and building assets. He also challenges traditional notions of work and encourages readers to think outside the box when it comes to generating income.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their financial literacy and take control of their finances.

I have scense read 5 more books in his series taking notes from each book to build my own financial game plan. I am now out of bad debt, have control over my financial statement, and actually have an emergency fund, and am now looking for my first investment.Word of warning. these books teach mindset, theory, and suggests next steps - not so much straight answers. all of your financial education is literally up to you.

RKKTNCFBHH5EE,rj,"3 stars book, 5 stars for the content and the message.I actually got this book back in 2003 or so, but discarded it.. big mistake!  If I had listened to him on RE investing back in 2003 and piled up, I would have done well, though it would have been a lot of risk as well.now years later, I decided to buy an updated copy and read again.  While there's not much new content, his messages are even more important today than ever.  As I type this, we're in global financial crisis, and a massive amount of wealth is completely wiped.  Govt keeps printing more money to save the stock market and economy.I disagree with him on investing in RE unless you got them cheap; in normal times, buying rental RE may be great idea, and I even seriously considered it last yr.  If I had bought rental RE, I be heavily screwed right now; we're heading towards massive unemployment due to the virus, so people will rent your apt units, but they have no money to pay rent and won't pay... they'll simply live for free, and you can't evict them either.  At same time, you're screwed with paying heavy mortgages.  RE investing is good if you're handy and willing to do most of the work yourself, but it's really a full time job if you got multiple units, and you must find good tenants.Going to college is not necessarily stupid, but going to an expensive one probably is.Owning a home is not stupid either, but owning an expensive home maybe esp if you can't afford it and do it just to show off to friends/family.I agree with those that criticize the book for giving no detail on how find and invest in RE or anything else; it does present a lot of ideas and makes you think.  And there's a lot of repeat in the book, just to be repeated again at the end of each chapter summary, otherwise this can be a 30pages book.if you can look past that, then it's a good book to read.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 25 March 2020,really makes you think,4,,1

R209AKDXAEZSOM,Lee,"This book is written from the perspective of someone who's much older than those who are reading it.  The techniques he used to get ahead probably aren't going to work for the modern person.  The advice is all good, if you're already at least upper middle class, and need ideas on how to get ahead EVEN MORE, but they aren't anything groundbreaking.  The whole thing can be boiled down to make risky investments for a payoff later.  But again, this is 2020.  The author is 73 years old!  The reason he can keep doing these things successfully is because he has the money from a time prior to when money was heinously difficult to get for most of us.  Maybe in the 50's or 60's, you could get a job that paid you well, without needing a degree and the crippling college debt that comes with it, but that's just not a thing that exists in this day and age.  Freakin' fast food joints and chain restaurants are full of people with bachelor's degrees, trying to pay off $100,000 of student loan debt and still LIVE somehow.  The things that worked for his generation are NOT going to translate well into our global, internet world, where we are at such end stage capitalism that you're literally more likely to win the lottery than to be able to move up from the wealth class you were born into.  That's a depressing, statistical fact that I've been fighting to change my whole life.  This book gives false hope toward those ends.  It has no sense of reality, and its appeal is only in the sense of ""preaching to the choir"".  You want good advice?  Get a book written by someone who's made money in the world we actually live in!  This is just a boomer, reliving his glory days, pretending that his success has anything to do with his intelligence, when it was really just that he was riding that gravy train most Boomers benefited from.  Must've been nice to be able to get a good job, right out of your free public high school, buy a house, cars, and still have money left over TO invest.  That's not reality when housing costs are 300% or more what they were for his generation, even though inflation overall has only been around 20%, on top of basically being a second class citizen if you don't have a bachelor's degree.We tried free capitalism.  It doesn't work long term.  Time to admit that the whole thing is end stage and regulate our economy better than his generation did.  Don't take his advice and contribute even further to the stuff that made you want to buy this to get ahead in the first place.  Fight for better wealth distribution, for healthcare, for things that should be free to all of us when our country and planet are so abundant that we don't need this outdated system that inevitably creates wild inequalities.  I know you want a fast, easy answer to get ahead, but it doesn't exist.  This book won't make it happen.  If you have compassion in your heart for those who come after you, fight this garbage system we live in and stop supporting people who take so much more than they need, and give lessons to others about how to do it.  Gross.  People are going to look back on this period of time one day, and look at this whole thing, the way we look back on medieval kings and queens, who hoarded wealth while their subjects starved.  It's the EXACT same thing, in a different time, in different severity.  Just because we don't starve, doesn't mean anyone needs a billion dollars while the national median income is $61,000 a year, and the poverty rate is OVER TEN PERCENT.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 12 August 2020,"End Capitalism, yall.",1,,297

RXGS05XP5KQ94,Marcus Hedgecock,"Overall, It's a fun book, but it is full of not-so-good advice and just plain bad advice that you shouldn't take seriously. My rating is a reflection on the technical advice in the book, and if it's good or bad. I assume that's what people care about.Robert seems like the type of guy who would tell you not to go to school. Are you sure that's good advice? Would you rather have a degree or no degree when convincing people to invest in your business? Would you rather have a degree or no degree when applying for a position that multiple people want? While it's true that a college education isn't a guarantee of a good job, it still improves how people view you. It improves your credibility. So, if you have the chance to go to college, it would be a good idea to get a degree. Robert has also been quoted as saying, ""the best way to get even with A-grade students was to make them employees of mine."" Why would he say that? He most likely said it because he has something against people that are smarter than him. He seems jealous and bitter when it comes to education. He also wrote a book called ""If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, Don't Go To School."" Are you for real? I started out with nothing more than fast food experience and a minimum wage paycheck. I didn't get lucky like others who seem to just find success in work and careers. Should I have continued with only my fast food foundation? No, going to school was the right idea. Also, Robert isn't the best business man. He gets most of his money from these Rich Dad seminars and whatnot (which people claim are ""scams."" Research that for yourself), and has had various business ideas fail. He's not someone that you should go to for advice.So, why is this book so popular? Maybe it's because people enjoy this self-help motivational nonsense that just makes you feel good. I guess I feel motivated, but I'm really not going to be doing what he says.Also, the ""Rich Dad"" isn't even a real person. He made it up. And, who exactly has the luxury to be like the Rich Dad, someone who is able to create numerous successful businesses and have other people work for him/her? I don't have that luxury. That just shows how fictional the Rich Dad is. Most of us have to work for money (which is against his advice), because it's 100% necessary. I started with nothing just like everyone else, and I have to work. Most of his readers that take this seriously... I'm willing to bet they have to work, too! I didn't have a magic money bag show up that I could start multiple businesses with, and neither does anyone else. One 'serial entrepreneur' I know still has to keep her job, even though she has excellent ideas. This is often how it is in the real world! Robert seems to live in a fantasy world.His advice about homes not being assets... it's false. Homes are literally assets, considering that the definition of an asset is that it is property owned by a person or company. They go up and down in value, just like in the stock market. Simply citing the 2008 financial crisis isn't a good enough reason to say they aren't assets. You can make good and bad decisions with owning real estate, just like with any other asset. You can make money off of it, or lose money.In the end, it's kind of fun but it is generally a work of fiction. Though some things may be true (like his real dad being an educator), many of the things in the book should not be taken seriously and are fictional.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 1 May 2020,"Fun, but don't take it seriously",2,,10

Rich Dad Poor Dad is the ""red pill"" that removes you from the Matrix; it opens your eyes to the world of financial possibility instead of the hamster wheel of 9 to 5 work that seems impossible to break.This is a mindset book for those that need it most, and frankly I'd say most of us do.

R31E7D7RZ0Q04Y,fatgurlofsanjoaquin,"Sir Robert nailed it!  I found this book pretty amusing book since the author, Sir Robert, was able to describe perfectly the characteristics of people who will NEVER be rich because of the incorrect mind set instilled by the old system (i.e. school, parents, etc).I have been an entrepreneur for quite a long time now but unfortunately, i lose money because I did not understand fully how the money works and the quadrant that Mr. Kiyosaki provided in this book helped me significantly in spending the money that I earn not just in my personal life but also in my business.Expect this book to provide a framework that can open our minds in order to fully understand what we are doing wrong that is why we remain poor.Expect this book to open the eyes of the reader to pinpoint what attitudes we possess and what we can do about it in order to escape the great rat race.Furthermore, do not expect this book to tell you where to invest your money, or what to do to become rich tomorrow or by next week.  Expect this book to teach the reader to change the mind set and the attitude towards money.Treat this book as a self improvement book, being rich is just the result of aligning a person's perspective and attitude.  If anyone wants to improve themselves, i highly recommend this book.  Learn the principles of it and put it into practice.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 28 August 2019,Eyeopener,5,,1

R3HN395EYB8NFJ,Stephen Smart,"I am interested in investing lately and so many people say this is a good book to read. All I can say is... what does it have to do with investing? Everybody already knows the rich don't work for money and they make their money work for them. Not a new concept, and yes, I know this is old by todays standards. He has some interesting enough stories that may or may not be true about his 2 daddies but the lessons he learned (and is teaching) are kind of common sense/old hat and I thought everyone knew these things already. I even heard someone on a podcast the other day say they went back and re-read this, I had to think it would be for inspiration I guess, otherwise ""why?"". I can't see reading it again. I am looking more for hardcore investing knowledge, not some theatrical stories about someone's life and how they were able to swing a few sweet real-estate deals back in the 70s when houses on the shore in Hawaii were $18k (those were the days). I guess the take home on this would be look for ways outside of the common 40hr work week humdrum to make money, who doesn't want to do that?!?",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 15 March 2022,Not as deep as I would have liked,3,,4

R1VD32I5XOSXZX,Janz,"I read this book years ago and was blown away by a simple yet profound statement 'your house is not an asset'. It had a big impact on me at the time and forced me to finish re-reading it again today. The concepts and insights are just too relevant today than before. Kiyosaki's point of view on how money works, how the rich view money vs poor, how the thinking of having more money will solve the problem, but it's the lack of financial education that is the problem amongst many others are priceless learnings.Without financial intelligence, we all too often use the standard formulas to get through life: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes. The concepts on taxes and cash flow pattern on why rich get richer and middle class are penalized are brilliant.If there is a book that's changed my thinking (and hopefully my life in the future), it's got to be this one.

The book is interesting because Robert uses stories and visual examples to make information easy to understand and remember. I have also played his game Cash Flow online and it's a great way to solidify the principles he teaches. They are simple principles, but it takes practice to internalize then because it's not how most people in the lower or middle classes think.Keep an open mind while reading this book, because you're going to find out that everything you know about money, assets, and liabilities is wrong.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 19 September 2021,Excellent Advice,5,,0

R1XMTDFBK8T0XP,Happy Go Lucky,"The timing of reading this book was perfect for me. Prior to reading it I read Overcoming Under Earning and Secrets of a Millionaire Mind. And I am glad I did because it put me in a more receptive frame of mind for Rich Dad Poor Dad. Written 20 years ago, it's relevant even more today and explains the huge gap we have in society. It has made me totally rethink the way I look at money and I expect more from my money. I wish I read this book when I was younger but better late than never. I am young enough to make a difference in my future.I gave it 4 stars for a couple of reasons. The silver bullet reference took his point way too far. Suicide is at an all time high and the reference is highly insensitive to people who have lost a loved one. Also I thought the review of each chapter was a total waste of paper.That aside, I feel like parents would do their kids a huge favor to make them read this book in high school.

RO5T3TXDGRCEK,Aaron Wills,"I heard about this book MANY years ago on a radio show and ever since, have had a craving to read it.  When I finally ordered it, I had planned to read it, then give it to my young adult children to read.  Now that I have read it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  The method and mindset of this approach to acquiring wealth will probably only be successful about one out of a thousand tries.  In reality, I feel that far more people will lose what money they have rather than acquiring wealth if attempting the strategies presented in this book.I feel it is also presents a self-centered values structure and discredits many people (teachers, mentors, professionals, small-business owners) along the way.  To have a productive society, it takes lots of ""poor dads"" who are working hard and contributing in ways that have much more value than simply generating wealth for self.  I'll give it two stars though because at least I learned something from this book:  I don't want to be a rich dad.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 5 November 2022,I don't think this advice will be helpful to very many people.,2,,5

RGI690V5XX1EC,Felix R.,"First regarding the POSITIVE:The author has one extremely strong, extremely true point (which explains the good reviews). Financial education in our education systems is non existent. Therefore people who don't have a teacher who is already rich (like ""rich dad"") it's hard for people to ever get there because they don't understand what they have to do.What they have to do is learn, aquire financial intelligence and invest like crazy. No fear, always on the lookout and strike when a chance presents itself. Don't buy liabilities like cars, homes etc if you don't have enough income from your assets like stocks, real estate etc to cover the costs. That's how let your money work for you to make more money.And that's about everything you get from the book.The NEGATIVE:Around this valuable and true message the author garnishes the story with standard capitalism statements, praising ""investors"" like Donald Trump all too often as his idols who - we all know by now - isn't all that good of an investor after all begging his followers for money...The book also is just way too repetitive. It explains a story/concept on 15 pages and follows up with a summary that is 10 pages. You basically read the same formulations and sentences again. How is that supposed to help or keep the attention? Most people start skipping through the repetition part I suppose.And that's the biggest problem. Whereas the author has a great, strong message he lacks in story telling and readers attention retention. A lot of the value gets lost because of it.For me overall a disappointing read that took me way longer than it should have - because of the constant and overhauling repetition and at points the lack of motivation to keep reading because of the reasons mentioned above.",Reviewed in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on 17 February 2022,"One good message, lots of bullshit around it",2,,6

I renovated the house and got a mortgage for the same amount I purchased and renovated it for, and paid back the unsecured loan that was at a much higher interest rate. Then I turned around and rented the house. The rent payments cover my monthly jeep payments and the renter is purchasing the house next year which after expenses will pay off my loan on the jeep!

Some of the concepts he talks about like assets, making money and others were pretty new concepts, but the one piece of advice that Roberts shares that I think is the most important takeaway is raising your financial intelligence.Since I read the book, Iâ€™ve come across so many videos and podcasts online where people mention this book as the one that started it all for them.Iâ€™m not 100% sure whatâ€™s next for me, but I do know that I have a huge appreciation for Mr.  Kiyosaki, and Iâ€™m excited to start working on a better future for myself.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 15 May 2019,The one book I always hear about (besides the Bible),5,,0

R2S99IN2HEFJZV,Pretty Shirts,Easy read. I recommend every parent start reading this book to the elementary age child (ren). They will never be taught how to be successful with money and life. Every child should be exposed to the possibilities of doing better than their parents financially especially when they don't have a trust fund to look forward to.

I also heard he went bankrupt and it does not make sense to listen to one who has done that.  He advocates buying real estate and becoming an entrepreneur.  Ever since the U.S. government told landlords to not charge rent from their tenants during covid, that investment seems most unwise.  Becoming an entrepreneur may work for some but many businesses fail and not everyone has the cash or is young enough to start all over.

It's not how he says it that mathers rather what is important.

Although most of the important and foundational information is in the beginning of the book, what makes this book so popular is that it promotes a powerful mindset and redefines common financial terms into easy to grasp concepts. After reading this book you will have a much better idea on the misconceptions people have about finances and why everyone is trained to work for money instead of making money work for them.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 25 February 2020,A must read for hopeful investors,4,,0
R1Y2Y9U05JYSYH,Louie heubisch,Not really worth a read if you ask me.  Really just a personal testimony about some guy (Mike's dad) who own's a bunch of businesses.  That's great... Really.. BUT the writer insinuates that this is the only way to grow your wealth..  That is so far from factual it's crazy.  One of the first lines in the book is about how habitual savers (lower & middle class) are doing themselves a disservice and will remain poor.  WHAT?!  How is this possible when 60% of the lower middle class has less than 5k in their savings?

R1O2ACHKEW3T01,Henryk Sadzik,"So I've given this a one star review and it's not because it's a badly written book, but rather because  the book seems plainly designed to lure you into parting with more of your money via his website and numerous follow up courses. The tale of his Rich Dad and Poor Dad is a nice one, though frankly it rings false, as does the man himself.On the positive side, the book does get you thinking about your finances, however it offers you no solutions as to how to actually make money. Like a lot of these types of 'self help' books, Kiyosaki takes one message and recycles it constantly. He is happy to tell you the problem, but not the solution. For this you should subscribe to his website and part with more money. This, undoubtedly, is where the real magic is and where you will learn all the great man's secrets for acquiring wealth. Enter credit card details here.Colour me sceptical, but I do have to wonder why someone with Kiyosaki's supposed riches needs to sell you these courses. Is it because this is truly where all his wealth comes from?If you want to make money, then save yourself Â£9.99, don't buy this book, and you'll be ahead already",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 25 July 2020,Oh Dear.

Just as the rich can afford better education, the rich will be able to keep themselves alive, while those who have little wealth will die.â€œFrom a person who lives in a country with â€œsocialisedâ€ healthcare system, this is absolute nonsense. Decisions are not based on age or money but on likelihood of treatment improving the patientâ€™s quality of life. If there is no chance in the world of improving a 100 year oldâ€™s quality of life, why would you not use the resources on a younger patient who has more chances of benefiting. It is actually  private healthcare systems that make decisions based on the size of a patientâ€™s bank account.

This book is for them.For me, and I'm not a great investor, but I know what I am doing is prudent and what I could be doing would make me rich, I find this book frustrating. For example, the author speaks about real estate investing and has a line ending a paragraph that says ""I typically only keep my real estate holdings for 7 years."" and has no follow up explanation. Wait, why 7 years? Tax benefits? Depreciation? What's the strategy?I'll save you a few bucks and tell you everything in this book you need to know.1- Money makes money. Don't rely on a job. Invest in income generating assets.2- Don't buy a bunch of crap, consume less, save and invest more.3- If you do move forward with investing, incorporate your self for liability and tax purposes.4- Rely on yourself, it's the only thing you can control.

Most of the ideas lack detail and here have no following actions or examples - just stories of being awesome and getting rich.Finally he forgets to mention the element of luck or the option of bootstrapping your wealth. Also seems very keen on tax avoidance and inside trading, which although they might not be illegal, it is a grayzone you do not want to tramp over.

R33EDCK3Y6MV7W,Abhishek Rakhecha,"1. Don't set Goals : Writer kehte he ki goal set karne ki bajay ek system pe focus karna chaiyeGoals set krna achi bat he lekin us goal ko achieve karne k liye system ko behtar banana padega jo hame us goal tak pahuchayega.Agar British Cycling team ki bat kare to gold medal jeetna to unka goal shuru re raha tha, lekin Dave ne jab system ko better banaya, to goal apne ap achieve ho gaya.Maan lijiye apka room bikhra pada he. Ap ek goal set krte ho ki mujhe room clean karna hee to ek bar room clean ho jayega, lekin agar ap apni chijo ko sahi jagah rkhne ki adat bana lo to apka kamra kabhi bikhra milegha hi nai.2 â€“ Change your Identity :Apni buri adato ko change krne ke liye hame adto ko chang karne s  pehle apne aap ko change karna ki jrurt hoti he .Hamari adte hamari identity ko follow krti he .Example k liye â€“Man lijiye ek insan cigarette chodne ki koshish krta he . Is douran jab use koi cigarette offer karta he to vo ye kahta he â€œ nahi yar, me cigg chodne ki kosis kar raha huâ€™Usnea bhi tak apni identity nahi badli. Vo apne ap ko abhi bhi smoker manta he.Lekin, agar  vo ye kahe ki â€œ nahi yar, me cigg nahi pitaâ€ is se vo apni identity change kar leta he. Ab vo apne ap ko non smokere consider karta he . This new identity motivates that person to stick with it.3 â€“ Change your Environment  -Hamare sath akshar esa hota h ki ham kitchen me jate to paani pine k liye, lekin hamari nazar chips k packet pe padti he or ham use khane lagte he .Hairani ki baat ye he ki hame na to bhookh lagi thi or na hi chips khane ki ichha hui thi.Malls vale yahi technique use krte he, mehange or profitable products racks me upar or ankho ki range me rakhi jate he jo customer ko easily notice ho jate he .And chances are that customers in products ko jrurt na hote hue bhi kharid lete he.Isi technique se ham bhi kisi bhi habit ko abopt kar skte he ya kisi bad habit ko chord bhi skte he.Fruits jyada khanee h ? to fruit basket ko vaha rkho jaha ap apna din ka sabs jyada time spnd krte ho. Jab fruits apki ankho k samne rahnge to ap automatically unhe consume krne lag jaoge.Padhai krt krte distract hote h to padhai k liy alag room, ya room me  alag table  ko study zone bana do. Yani padhai bed pe nhi usi enviorment m kroge, to apka mind kam distract hoga qki usko pata h k aap study zone m ho.4. Donâ€™t run for the best: Ek choti si interesting si story share krta hu. Florida University ke ek professor ne apne photography students ko 2 groups me divide kiya.  Pehle group ko yeh challenge diya ki unko pure semester jyada se jyada photos submit karne he , 100 photos submit krne vale ko A grade, 90 vale ko B.Or dusre group ko challenge diya to submit only 1 photo but that has to be the perfect one. Jiska photo sabse perfect hoga usko A grade, or us se kam vale ko B grade milega.Interesting.At the end of the semester saare best photos surprisingly first group se aye.Aap bhi soch rahe honge k esa kese hua, dusra group jisne pura semester ek photo ko perfect krne me lagaya unke photos best rank me q nahi aye ?Because jaha dusra group ek hi photo ko perfect banana me laga raha, pehle group ne jab bahot sare photos click kiye to isi ke sath unki skills bhi enhance hoti rahi. Vo har photo me experiment karte rahe or apni hi mistakes se sikhte rahe.Agar apko business krna he ya startup krna he or best idea ya best opportunity  k liye ruke he to ap kabhi start hi nahi kar paynege,Jo bhi idea he jesi bhi opportunity he uspe jab mehnat ki jayegi to vo hi best ban jayega.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 4 February 2022,4 Lesions I learnt from this Book,4,,1351

RUXULQ9837FNT,Ankit jaiswal,"Atomic Habits is a book written by James Clear that provides practical strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. The book is based on the idea that small, incremental changes can have a big impact on our lives over time.The term ""atomic"" refers to the small, fundamental units that make up larger systems. In the context of habits, atomic habits are the small actions that we take on a daily basis that accumulate over time to produce significant results. Clear argues that by focusing on making small, consistent improvements in our habits, we can achieve long-term success.The book is divided into four sections, each of which focuses on a different aspect of habit formation:The Fundamentals: Clear outlines the basic principles of habit formation and how habits work.The Four Laws of Behavior Change: Clear introduces four key principles for building good habits and breaking bad ones: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying.The Four Steps of Habit Formation: Clear provides a detailed guide for creating new habits, including how to choose the right cues and rewards.Advanced Tactics: Clear shares strategies for optimizing and maintaining habits over the long term.Overall, Atomic Habits is a practical and actionable guide for anyone looking to make positive changes in their life through habit formation.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 2 March 2023,Atomic Habits is a book written by James Clear,5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71B8lrLELkL.jpg,10

R2U37M9GFU3CCO,Anshu Rai,"A book filled with all the pragmatic approaches toward habit building.All in all, the author has done a great job as the book hits the right spot from the very start. It provides a reader with various perspectives, provides handy solutions, charts, and tables to enable the habit forming process. With the book, the author has genuinely tried on providing every possible tool for a reader to sail through smoothly in the process of habit formation and sticking to it.The book does its job of making a novice understand the way mind works, comprehending the science of habit formation, and providing the ways to alter the pattern by creating new habits or deleting the existing ones.It is packed with the knowledge of psychology, or on the actual wiring of mind. Also, it brings references from the paleolithic age from time to time, and the author has done an exemplary work at making it all interesting, and easy to comprehend via graphs, and effortless writing.Also, the author has mentioned numerous examples from day to day life, and from the sports team we follow from, from the last Olympics games and more, to make the subject or the topic more relatable.When writing is concerned, there is a consistency throughout however, there are times when it becomes repetitive and dull.

R242DW6SQ1NB7P,Anu,"I bought the book because it is a bestseller and had great reviews but when I was discussing it with my partner, I was asked a series of interesting questions.If there was ever an easy and proven way to change all bad old habits or add any new good habit, why the best-known minds in Psychology like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung were addicted to smoking, along with best ever physicist Albert Einstein? And if someone has found an easy and proven way to build only good habits and break all bad habits recently then why it is not suggested by all doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists and why the inventor of such a critical thing has not given Nobel price in Physiology or Medicine as it would prevent so much premature death and suffering? How the claim of the author â€œguide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossibleâ€ can be possible when the human brain is so complicated, that still we understand only a little about it today? Also, can Albert Einstein or all other minds improve 1% every day for their whole life?I found all questions valid and the idea of the book deceptive. I soon came to know that habits are hardwired in the brain and to remove all old habits forever would mean physically removing all the corresponding neural circuits. What one can do however is to develop a new habit that can counter or control the old habit and it will take time and practice. But again, behaviors can be primed and automatically activated from the internal or external cues and it can get extremely convoluted because of endless other genetic, psychological, biological, neural, social, environmental, computational and rest of the known and unknown natural factors related to the human brain. It is wrong to say that we all can break all bad habits forever and add only good ones and it is even harder to decide what is good and what is bad.Identical twins are not exactly the same even when they have the same genes as it is the gene-environment interaction that shapes us and makes each of us unique. Many can obviously break some old bad habits and many can obviously build new good habits but not all can stop all bad habits and not all can install all good habits. And not all can decide what is good and bad. If that would be the case then the world will become perfect in an instant â€“ we all know what is good and bad and we all do it.Also if you are already at a peak, 1% improvement every day will compound to extreme new heights in a few years which is not practical for a brain that is bounded. If you are at the bottom, you can improve 1% every day for a few days but it is not sustainable. Information processing and storage of the nervous system is limited and it just cannot improve 1% every day, for the whole life. It is just not possible. No player always plays his or her best we generally tend to oscillate around the mean. If Einstein improved 1% every day he would have invented endless other new theories. At times we can improve a lot in a few days but not always and not every day.I was suggested book cognitive fitness by my partner earlier but it is was a little bit complicated for me and now I can understand why. The human brain itself is complicated.I am not sure about habits, but the author has sure found an easy way to make money.I may post more on this as I learn more about the behaviors.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 26 July 2021,A naive and delusional interpretation of a complex phenomenon,1,,140

The concepts present an action plan for trying them in your own situation and to practice the ideas directly in day to day life.  This makes the book an instruction manual for nurturing good habits and killing bad habits.  I was able to immediately relate to many new habits to start and many not so good habits I can stop and avoid using the identification pattern provided in the book.The principle presented in the book about understanding who to become, that is finding out what identity to achieve instead of just starting or stopping a habit is very helpful.One important aspect of this book is the to the point summary provided after every chapter.  Once you have read the book this summary helps recall all the concepts in short time and becomes a concise model to revise the concepts.The book is engaging and is suitable for reading cover to cover as it provides many stories and references.  As the concept of process than goals was already known to me through the Learning How to Learn MOOC at Coursera, I was glad to find the same concept mentioned in this book and was able to relate quickly with the principles.The book also becomes a workbook and reference material once you have gone through it.  The chapters are divided into sections which can be referred for particular situation in hand.I will recommend this book for anyone who is eager to understand why habits are formed and how to nurture good habits and avoid bad ones.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 27 October 2018,Atomic Habits by James Clear is highly recommended read,5,,846

R1O29FPG4GYCRJ,Rohan jora,"Whether you are a victim of procrastination or struggling with your routine; whether you are a victim of bad habits or struggling to quit them; then Atomic Habits by James Clear, a consummate professional in behavioral psychology and habit formation, is the best self-help book for you. This book can make a huge difference that manifests remarkable results when practically applied to our life.It is divided into six parts- from fundamentals to advance tactics- which could provide a proven framework with examples, and step-by-step methods for making good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying and bad habits invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying. Every chapter has its summary for the readers to recall the important points in the chapter whenever they need.This book provides supplementary cheat sheets, templates, a journal that are very useful for the practical implementation of various ways and techniques mentioned in this book.I also discovered, at first to my consternation and then to my pleasure, that how basic factors, that are often underrated, are responsible for the formation of habits and making them long-lasting.The read is exceptionally interesting and flowing. I've completed this book within a week and, to my better understanding, I jotted down notes in my journal to implement them in my day-to-day life. After reading this book, I've been truly inspired by James Clear's work that I even subscribed to his Newsletter and 30 Days To Better Habits on JamesClear.com.I would highly recommend this exponentially self-improvement book to everyone.Life-changing Book5â­ï¸",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 9 December 2021,Life-transforming Book,5,,1

R1GEFGL909JVTN,Sree Nidhi Tumu,"I am not really a person interested in self-help books but this book has changed that notion of mine.The author gives real life examples before the start of each chapter which I found really interesting. For me, this book isn't just about habits or how to develop good habits and discard bad ones, but it is more about understanding 'why we behave the way we behave'. The author gives four laws of behaviour change and each law provides a set of rules to create good habits and break bad ones. The laws are explained in detail giving a lot of examples.Also, this book is filled with so many inspiring quotes! I love reading quotes when I feel low or demotivated and this book has so many good quotes. They are definitely going on the whiteboard in my study room!Some of my favorite ones are:When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you donâ€™t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it.Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible.It's crucial to show up when you donâ€™t feel like itâ€”even if you do less than you hope.The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.Happy reading!",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 22 August 2021,Amazing book!,5,,3

R3NPRGZ5VJAYWC,Kindle Customer,"This book would most suit the person who has tried time and again but failed to cultivate certain habits or the young hopeful, all the same.  It is not going to teach you to succeed in your goal. It'll point you to the right set of systems that might sustain your habit.The author, true to his surname, is very clear in the way he has progressed through the book. Each chapter is a beautiful extension of the previous one like how a water droplet follows another that makes a beautiful waterfall. Very well structured and thought through that it could well be a thriller.Another aspect of technique that i love about this book is the way each chapter opens. It's always with an example from a different field of profession - sports, operations, advertising, philosophy and so on. This makes you relate to the problem he's discussing in the chapter and the eventual solution. It gives a bigger canvas to grapple with the concept.Things that could have been better -- If you are someone very young and have not failed in anything before -  not everything in the book is for everyone. There are things that might work and some might not. The author also makes this disclaimer albeit a little late in the book.If you are searching for techniques to abstain from a bad habit then you'll be disappointed. This book doesn't have much on that front.  There are some pointers but not as detailed as the positive habit building techniques.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 27 May 2021,A very concise lesson in human behaviour,5,,0

New books have tight binding but this one has looser binding so it was either used before or poorly made. I have ordered a replacement. Amazon should have stricter quality control standards with sellers and not allow them to sell subpar quality products. This quality of this book is like the books that are sold by second hand sellers. Buy this book from a bookstore instead of Amazon.UPDATE : I have received the replacement. This time they sent a new, good quality book. The pages in this replacement copy are regular good quality pages that one might find in a book bought from the bookstore and the binding is tight as well.

RYN39931LJDO6,Amazon Customer,"ATOMIC HABITSItâ€™s too early to tell if itâ€™s an effective book; but it sure is an inspiring one. Its appeal lies in making good habits seem so easily attainable. It highlights the power of tiny changes; of getting 1% better every day. Like, itâ€™s better to exercise for two minutes than to not exercise at all. Itâ€™s better to read just one page than to not read at all. Or for bad habits, try smoking one cigarette less even if you canâ€™t quit smoking altogether. It illustrates how a single and simple change can turn into a good habit; like by changing your environment to reduce friction towards the desired habit - place a bowl of fruits on your study table than storing it out of sight. Or signing up at a gym close to your place than one off route. It encourages locking your decisions before you give in to temptation. A lot of these tricks seem obvious and known; but entirely doable!The author, James Clear draws from the Japanese philosophy of Kaizen: micro changes, from Physics: the path of least resistance, from Biology: the response of our brains to instant gratification, etc. The drawback of the book, I felt, lies in that it lays a better roadmap for building good habits than for kicking bad ones.That said, after reading the book, I have begun going for a walk; remains to see how long I continue :)",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 9 October 2021,Doable tricks can lead to good habits.,3,,3

Atomic habit is one such insanely practical book which can be applied in life the moment you started reading this book. I remember a similar book I read a few years back 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg. I would say this book is a easier version than the power of habit book. Concepts are moreover similar in both the books. This book is just written in way so that it's easy to apply the learnings from the book of n daily life. The four key things for forming habits cue, craving, response, reward are discussed in detail in separate chapters. If you are looking for a great book  on habit formation read this one first and then you can read 'The Power of Habit' book. Only thing I felt extra and not required is the last one or two chapters.

R9NEAXSEIRWNO,ganesh b.,One of the best books I ever read on Self Help. This is definitely going to end up on my top 10 books in the self-help category. The book clearly states why we do by getting into the bones of it. The tools and strategies given are very sensible and easy to apply. This book is a must-read for all those people who wonder why they are slacking when doing the things that matter to them most. It also addresses why motivation does not last long and how we need to keep going even when motivation does not exist. The book also depicts graphically how everything we do eventually adds up in the end and why people give up when they don't see the results.If you need a clear blueprint on how to change old habits and stick to new ones and understand the science behind habits and systems that create them this is a must-read.,Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 6 January 2021,One of the best books in the Self Help Category,5,,2

R1PAIYDH51EL8J,Venkat,"James did a terrific job of knowledge synthesis in this book and Manson's approval of it as ""a supremely practical and useful book"" is not an overstatement.The author has ended my lifelong search of how to make habits stick, with his masterful display of four magic laws, and I am finding the book a nugget of wisdom.To me the book's premise (not necessarily the author's statement) is simple: If you want to get to your goal, change your systems, which are nothing but our habits. In other words your goals are defined by your tiny habits, and by corollary, your habits create your goals.By doing exercise daily you create a healthy you, but by smoking daily you create the goal of getting terminal illness. Habits are the foundation of the self.Mr. Clear, you've transformed me, down to the atomic scale, for good.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 25 August 2020,"It deserves 5 stars, only after I make the best use of the book",4,,1

But it also explains about small ways to overcome it which we generally don't focus much.James Clear has arranged the topics cohesively that we slowly start believing his idea that any habit can be stopped or created through mere slow progress.This book would impact every reader positively in some way or the other which I think is essential for any self help book.Trust me.

The author has very accurately mentioned the various methods by which we can change ourselves and ultimately our lives. But after a couple of months reading it and trying out the techniques mentioned I find myself standing right where I started. After reading many other self help books from famous authors ,watching numerous videos on YouTube I am coming to a conclusion that it doesn't matter how many books have you read ,how many videos have you watched ,how many techniques you applied, until you know your WHY. Those who have already read different books on the subject would understand and those who have just started will understand when they are ready.Overall for the book I would say it's a great book which hits right on point. It's a must read for everyone who are trying to change. And it's a must read for those who have just started their journey on the subject.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 9 October 2019,Must read for everyone,5,,2

R3I7CES52L06U4,Aloknath,"Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones"" by James Clear is a self-help book that focuses on the power of small habits in shaping our lives. The main message of the book is that success and achievement come from the accumulation of small, consistent actions over time, rather than one-time big efforts.Clear outlines a simple, step-by-step framework for building new habits and breaking old ones. He emphasizes the importance of making habits as small and easy to start as possible, so they become second nature over time. The book also covers the science of habit formation and how to design an environment that supports the habits you want to build.The book emphasizes that habits are the building blocks of a successful and fulfilling life, and offers practical strategies for using habits to improve health, relationships, finances, and more. In summary, ""Atomic Habits"" is a comprehensive guide to creating good habits, breaking bad ones, and living a more intentional life.But like all the self-help books it is not without the build ups. So getting the substance out of hay is a challenge.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 8 February 2023,habit changer book,4,,0

R17PHZ42AIQYT5,Bharath Ramakrishnan,"Many people I know have read this book and recommended it to me since some time. While I read a good amount of non-fiction, I find new ideas are hard to come by over time. The good thing is that this book did have some well laid out concepts, and was also less pretentious than much of the self-help fare available.The central idea is that you can start small and build lasting habits. This book has practical tips for building personal habits. I liked the concept of â€˜identityâ€™ â€“ it felt fresh and very logical, though not immediately apparent. How we think of ourselves is critical to building habits. For instance, thinking of yourself as a writer, reader or runner causes the brain to react differently than saying â€˜I will write a bookâ€™, â€˜I will read a bookâ€™ or â€˜I will run 5 milesâ€™. Another important takeaway is around pursuing goals vs running systems. Everybody has goals and it is not goal setting which leads to success, but the process. There is also coverage on how you can approach habit building systematically and make it easy & rewarding.Overall, a useful book which I think should deliver results. The later sections are bloated though, filling pages â€“ when the content should have been far crisper.I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author, and it was very good.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 15 August 2022,Good practical tips,4,,0

R1S3J3SSHXU7WF,Vikash Lavaniya,"During various stages of our lives, It is common for us to create different goals for various outcomes. However we plan, execute and put enormous efforts towards these goals but fail to hit the bulls eye. Be it lack of competence, resources, direction, discipline or anything which might be impacting the results.Often it is observed that we focus on the major steps to ignore the importance and impact of the comparatively smaller but important steps in the process.The book begins with the importance of starting, no matter how small it is to start, followed by a brief discussion on â€œWhy tiny changes make a big differenceâ€, and gradually discusses about a routine or behavior that is performed regularly â€“ and, in many cases, automatically.I feel the book can be referred as a guide to build habits for the readers . The book is suitable to every age group and is a recommendation to everyone around who aspire to be better version of themselves and somehow struck with a few routine challenges.This book further contains information that helps building habits in routine and I found it very effective.

R3O18KY4KHTKBR,Rajiv Chopra,"Overall, I would say that this is a good book.I like the first sections the most. The most critical insight that I got from the book is the one where James Clear asks the reader to change the narrative if he â€“ or she â€“ wants to change. He gave the example of a smoker trying to quit smoking. He suggested that a smoker should say that he is not a smoker and not that he is trying to leave the habit. This example provides us with a powerful insight.The methodology that he has suggested to adopt a good habit â€“ or give up a bad one â€“ is excellent.From there on, the book tends to become repetitive.

Because ultimately, humans are wired to take the easier path! Makes a lot of sense.I gave it 4 stars because for  a 5-star rating I need to see a notable difference in my habits.

R33FBTJNNKUYRT,preeta chag,"Atomic Habits dwells on a premise: the smallest of a positive habit will create a profound, positive long-term effect.Let me confess by saying, that I do not usually read self-help or self-improvement books. But this book came highly recommended and as a gift to me.And it did not disappoint. In fact, it was a pleasure read for me.The book is simple and non-preachy.  James Clear has taken on a simple fundamental to create a winner book. Easy to follow and interspersed with examples, the book sets out to illuminate the power of cultivating a good habit to bring about a positive big difference in your life.He sets out to explain how to create good habits. Not an easy task, when you are trying a change which is not so easy (such as weight loss, boosting team morale, reading books). James Clear has presented a simple formula in neat steps for incorporating the change. Habit stacking, environmental cues, making the habit attractive are what he talks of when teaching us habit formulation.Actually,  the book has not thrown up anything novel. But it has very ingenuously used something very known and basic and created a story around it to emphasize the goodness and effectiveness of those ideas.What the book highlights and reinforces is:  Never give up on a small habit thinking that it will not bring about any change. In fact, the compound value of following the habit diligently and relentlessly is the secret behind the monumental positive change.As James Clear writes, â€œThe only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.â€",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 14 May 2022,A small change. A big difference.,4,,0

Starting small and delivering on it, will get the ball rolling eventually towards larger goals. The book is ""clear"" and every idea is reinforced by examples and real life situations.I have begun to try some of the techniques and hope it all works out eventually.

Because not only did it meet all the unrealistic expectations I had - it surpassed them!!It's definitely the best book on habits I've ever read!In-fact I personally found this one to be better than The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, which I believe is more widely known as the go-to book on understanding habits.And okay to be totally fair - The Power of Habit did indeed help me understand how habits are formed, but it was also kind of long winded, and included organizational & societal habits too (things that I personally wasn't interested in).This one on the other hand, was a straightforward guide on habit forming and/or breaking with lots of direct actionable tips and advice geared specifically to the individual.Which is why if this subject even remotely interests you -  GET THE BOOK right away!",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 13 August 2019,Best Book on Habits - Geared to the Individual!,5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tHrAh1ALL.jpg,1

R23LZINXK36581,Kushagra Singh,"# Book review- Atomic Habits by James ClearWe all can agree that the easier it is to grasp a concept, the higher the prowess of the one imparting it. On the attribute as mentioned, Mr James Clear aces his writing and book. If you have not read any self help books and are willing to take a plunge, this can be a fantastic start.The phenomenal power of small steps compounded over time is presented tactfully in Atomic Habits. What this book brilliantly does is to effectively establish in the reader's mind that even a slight bit of effort towards realising a particular goal, say a habit, can have far-reaching consequences.Mr James uses real-life examples from sports, his personal life, readersâ€™ experience amongst others to drive home the concepts he espouses. This technique adds the charm to the writing.Mr. Clear outlines 4 laws to behaviour change and as mentioned, using examples and science, he makes it easy for the reader to understand and effectively apply it to his/her personal life. I already have begun to make use of some of the brilliant techniques and hacks I learned from this book.It is a must-read for anyone looking to improve their life.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 3 February 2020,One of the best and easiest to read self help books,4,,0

R16Z11TV81K196,Cyril Danthi,"The surprising power of Atomic Habits : Habits are double edge sword. Habits are like the atoms in our lives. Each one is fundamental unit of that and contribute to the overall improvement. If we get 1 % better each day for one year, weâ€™ll end up thirty seven times better by the time weâ€™re done. This make habits as the compound interest of self-improvement.  The see of every habit is a single tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Habits are not Goals. The goals are about results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that leads to those results. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. Habits shape the identity and a typical framework as mentioned will aid in building them.  They areCue : The cue triggers the brain to initiate a behavior | Craving : These are the motivational force behind every habit.|  Response: The response is actual habit that is performed which take the form of a thought or an action |Reward :  The reward serve two purpose â€“ They satisfy the trigger and they teach.  Reward teach us which action are worth remembering in the future. Behavior is the function of the person in that environment. B=f(P,E), therefore Motivation is overrated; Environment often matters most. Family and Friends in play a major role in  shaping our habits.

R22CRF5IBXRZA,Selfhelpreads,"Book ReviewTitle: Atomic HabitsAuthor: James ClearPages: 306Reading Difficulty: Easy to readGenre: Self-help bookRating: 5/5About The Book: The book is about how small daily changes can become the difference between who you are and who you want to become. Normally we humans overestimate the value of one big defining moment but it is all those small, tiny improvements that create all the difference.Main Theme: The main theme of this book is how to create good habits and break the bad ones in 4 simple steps (laws)Here are those laws;The 1st Law: Make It Obvious.The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive.The 3rd Law: Make It Easy.The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying.Best Quote from the book: â€œEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.â€My Favorite Lesson: This book has many major learning lessons but I can't tell them all in the review ðŸ˜…As humans, we set goals to achieve the desired outcomes or results but when we fail, we think that we have set too high expectations for ourselves and we try to change the goals but it's not right, you are failing not because of your goals but because of the system that leads you to that outcomes.So whenever, you fail to get the desired outcome try to change the system through which you get the results.My Thoughts: This book is worth reading, every page and every lesson has Taught me something completely new, which I didn't know earlier. And yes, while reading this book reflect on the earlier times when you were trying to build good habits, you will certainly get a smile ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š on your face and you will get where you were going wrong.Who Should Read This: Every single person, who wants to build good habits and those who have failed in the past from creating that habits and also for those who want to break their bad habits, In short, It's for every person who is trying to become the version of himself. ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªHave a Good One,Keep Reading âœŒâœŒ.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 31 July 2021,One of the best book of the year,5,,0

RSHZQBDAJBJPG,Abhinav,"I depend a lot on my habits to be productive and efficient in my personal and professional routines. Habits have helped me get better slightly every day which becomes a lot better in a couple of months. I use habits for learning oil paintings, consistently working out, controlling my diet, gardening and being productive at my work.This started some time back some one year ago - when I overheard a friend telling how he learnt to play the guitar like a pro along with his tough office routine. He just said one thing - ""I played for 15 min. every day without fail for the last four years."".I personally have never like Self-help books - and I was very reluctant when I started reading Atomic Habits. I was afraid that my own resolve and habits that are serving me well may get disrupted. It was a real shock when I realised that I had been unintentionally following many of the recommendations James Clear makes in this book. Most people already know that they should develop good habits - but very rarely they create a system to make these good habits their routine.This book helped me rationalise many of the benefits that I had been observing in myself. This book gave me a context and a story to further convince myself to seriously continue the good habits. It has only strengthened my resolve and has also provided me with more tricks to get better in my habits.The biggest learning was that the same process which I was using to gain new habits could also be used for eliminating bad habits - which I was not focusing on.I would recommend this book for everyone who aspires to be a better version of themselves. But I will also advise everyone who is looking to drop a bad habit - from smoking, eating junk food, social media addiction, wasting time on games etc. to pick up this book once.But more than the book - I will recommend everyone to first internalise that habits can make you better.

R2LB51LTM3I6WA,Kumar Srikant,"James Clear tells the reader about the book Atomic Habits in the most effective and succinct way in the blurb: â€œAn easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones.â€He defines an atomic habit as a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. Atomic habits are part of a larger system. He says the phrase atomic habits means a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power.Right at the bookâ€™s beginning Clear explains the fundamentals of atomic habits with a remarkable story of the British cycling team and their coach, Dave Brailsford.Until 2003, when Brailford was appointed as performance director, British cycling had endured mediocrity for nearly a hundred years. The difference was the new coachâ€™s relentless commitment to a strategy he referred to as â€œthe aggregation of marginal gains.â€ Simply put it meansâ€¦searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.Brailford and his coaches broke down everything that goes into riding a bike, and sought to improve them by one percent. Then, when everything is put together, a significant increase in performance is achieved. The coaching team diligently looked into different areas, including unexpected and overlooked ones and came up with one percent improvements. The results came quick and fast:The British cycling team dominated the track cycling events in the 2008 Olympic games, winning a staggering 60 percent of the gold medals. The team continued to dominate and set new records in the next Olympic games. In the next six years, British cyclists went on to win five Tour de France titles.The building of a habit proceeds through four stages, in the same order. The four-step process called the habit loop by Clear is not an occasional one but an endless feedback loop, active and running during every moment of oneâ€™s life:Cue- Craving- Response- Reward.The cue triggers oneâ€™s brain to initiate a behavior. Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. Without craving a change, one has no reason to act. Response is the actual habit one performs, which can be a thought or action. Reward is the end goal of every habit. It satisfies oneâ€™s craving, while teaching which actions are worth remembering in the future.The author transforms the four steps into a practical framework that can be used to design good habits and eliminate bad ones. The framework is called the Four laws of behavior change: 1. Make it obvious (cue), 2. Make it attractive (craving), 3. Make it easy (response), and 4. Make it satisfying (reward).Enroute his exposition of the four laws of behavior change, Clear entertains the reader with inspiring stories, events and theories, seamlessly puts across the laws in the simplest and highly readable way. Here are some interesting revelations: Goals and systems:If you want better results, then forget about setting goals, focus on your system instead. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.-The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.-You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fail to the level of your systems.The Goldilocks rule: How to stay motivated in life and work:The rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.The core idea of the Goldilocks rule: Working on challenges of just manageable difficultyâ€”something on the perimeter of your abilityâ€”seems crucial for maintaining motivation.An excellent example of the Goldilocks rule in practice is the comedy career of American actor, Steve Martin. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine - but only by a minute or two. His victories were just enough to keep him motivated and mistakes, just enough to keep him working hard.Atomic Habits by James Clear, delves into the realm of habits, psychology, neuroscience, delineates steps, nuances and structure as to how to build a better habit as well as how to break a bad habit, build a system for getting 1 percent better every day, overcome lack of motivation and willpower and much more. Backed by copious research, notes, references and citations, Atomic Habits is indeed special, engaging and a go-to book.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 21 May 2021,"Atomic Habits is indeed special, engaging and a go-to book",5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9101Pj7ZZZL.jpg,0
R9AFLVNX8RFHF,Munmun Rudra,"Tiny Changes, Remarkable ResultsAtomic Habits by James ClearThe very title and the logline inserted with it provide enough glimmer on the theme of this book by James Clear. It is not only about forming good habits but also about eroding the bad ones. And the process allotted in this course of habit formation is superbly explained and illustrated by the writer not only in words and explanation, but also in multiple example and diagram.The book starts with an introduction, blood smitten and horrible. As a student of the sophomore year of high school the author met a horrible accident while playing baseball when a bat in a full swing struck his face and devastated it. Living with the post traumatic seizures and bulged eye ball from the socket, it took several months and years to survive, â€œâ€¦day faded into nightâ€¦ a series of machines kept me alive.â€ It was a real fight, and he took it as his challenge to come back to the life, â€œAnd I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen.â€ And he â€œâ€¦discovered the surprising power of small habits for the first time.â€â€œâ€¦changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if youâ€™re willing to stick with them for years.â€ â€œWith the same habits, youâ€™ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.â€â€œHereâ€™s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, youâ€™ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time youâ€™re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, youâ€™ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. 1% BETTER EVERY DAY 1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03 1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78.â€ Wow! How he explains everything in a mathematical way and pragmatically. We also get acquainted with many reputed theorists in the field of psychology and behavior like Thorndike, B. F Skinner, Charles Duhigg etc. and focus on the integrated model of cognitive and behavioral sciences and habit formation.â€œHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.â€Every chapter, every line carries a message as strong as the fleeting arrow, just â€¦ from the bow. They fill the heart with strong conviction, deliberate motivation.  Good habit is the source of self control and only a self controlled person can enjoy the life avoiding the trapping of tangled â€¦he introduces us with the four steps of a habit formation - cue, craving, response and reward. Forget about goals and stay focused on system instead.Every line is spirited, and how my fingers etched on the keyboard to copy each and every line of it. The chapter summery again helps a lot to sum up and revise what5 we learn throughout the chapter. Itâ€™s a discrete choice of style on his pert and obviously a prudent one. He focuses on building a system and then a habit, â€œâ€¦do not build outcome based habits. But build identity â€“ based habits.â€ He also gives importance on the â€˜beliefâ€™, â€œâ€¦ if you cannot change your underlying beliefs you cannot change your habits.â€And â€œtrue behavior change is identity change.â€How he became a writer,â€ I did not start out as a writer. I became one through my habits.â€ He assures us that â€œprocess of habit formation begins with trial and error,â€ â€œwalk slowly but never backwardâ€ and the Goldilocks Rule.This is a book, not just to go through and stock in your book self, but a guide for everyday life, a friend in every adversity.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 16 April 2021,most inspiring,5,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91epE4UWOpL.jpg,0
R3FL1MIHXT2X9N,Nathik,"Atomic Habits by James Clear has been one of the beneficial books that I have read this year. And I wanted to share the notes and ideas which helped me with you all.The crux of the book is that Habits are the compound interest of self improvement.  The effects of your habits multiplies as you repeat them just like money.  A simple change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.According to James Clear,  all habits revolves around the below four step model and any behavior change revolves around these steps.CueCravingResponseRewardAggregation of Marginal gains:It doesnâ€™t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What really matter is whether your habits are putting you in the right path to success. Instead of focusing on your current results, you should you concerned with your current trajectory. Your aim should be to become 1% better everyday. Winning tiny battles like hitting the gym each week, reading books each day and spending less than you earn each month will define your future.Can 1 % improvement really make any difference?Habits often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. People make few small changes and when they fail to see immediate results, they quit. This is the prime reason why people struggle to build habits that lasts.Mastery require patience. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiple whatever you feed it. Good Habits makes time your ally and Bad habits make time your enemy.Habits and Identity:The more pride you have in a particular aspects of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. James argues that identity is literally your â€œrepeated beingâ€. The frequency of your habits influence your identity and vice versa. The goal is NOT to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.Two step process:Decide the type of person you want to be.Prove it to your self with small wins.The First Law:Create a habit scorecard:Make a list of your daily habits.Once you list, look at each habits and ask yourself â€œIs this a good/bad or a neutral habit?.  Assign â€˜+â€™ if its a good habit, â€˜-â€˜ for bad habit and â€˜=â€™ for neutral habit.Design your environment:Environment is the invisible hand that shapes your behavior. If you want to make a behavior change, make a cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behavior will usually have multiple cues.Habit Stacking:Best way to build a new habit is to identity a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.The Second Law:We need to make our habits attractive so learn to associate them with positive experience. Sometimes all you need is a slight mind-set shift.The Third Law:If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You just need to practice it often. The more you repeat an activity, the more structure of your brain changes to become efficient at it. Example: Learn a new language, play an instrument require repetition.Two minutes rule:When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.Example: Read before bed each night becomes â€œRead one pageâ€. Run three miles becomes â€œtake out my running shoesâ€.The Fourth Law:What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished it avoided. Reward yourself after every new habit. Take a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk.Never miss twiceYou donâ€™t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. So always show up.Create a Habit contract:Create a habit contract with you partner or your friend. This will help you stay the course.These are some of the best points I have found helpful from the book.

R1HMQPF3U16YVK,Charan,"How long it would take to make a new habit? Many of us would've come across the famous answer ""It would just take 21 days to cultivate a new habit."" But James easily gets through that question in the early pages of this book by an evident ""threshold"".The author just spots the areas and hits the bull's eye in every single law to form or break a habit. The book is so tempting to know about the human psychology associated with behaviors. Each case study, each example, and each research associated with a particular law is helpful to create a lasting impression on the point that Clear is trying to make.While talking about Diderot with the ""Habit Stacking"" technique he slowly brings the current day behavioral economics. While talking about cues that are dependent on the environmental design, he backs it up with the Netherlands domestic power consumption results. While talking about habit tracking he gives a ""moving-a-paper-clip-from-jar-to-jar"" example. This way of putting things stays with me.Breaking down all the four laws and guiding on how to identify our niches based on trial and error methods that improve the favors of a game we would like to play is simply an eye-opener. I was so impressed with the detailed walkthrough of the ""explore and exploit"" method.If this book had just spoken about habit building, it would've been just another self-improvement book available. Instead, it just expanded the vision on why we need to build a retrospective approach behind the habits we wanted to cultivate at the end. It's equivalent to removing the tiny pebbles in our shoes before we climb the mountain.His simplicity throughout the book leaves me to grasp the point ""never stop making improvements"".We need to give this book to school and college students which would allow them to travel in the path of mastery.After all, Steve Jobs said,  ""In the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.""Recommend it? Must read!",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 22 May 2021,Do Not Interrupt the effect of Compounding,5,,2

R1T76YHCFNXD98,Kanwar Anand,"Like everyone else, I want to get better. I feel if i am more consistent, my effectiveness will increase. Atomic Habits is a great book that helps you identify where the flaws lie. Not just that it tells you more about the need to make little long lasting changes. The author is objective and looking at his past, I am surprised he is as objective as he is. I mean with the help of examples and simple language, he makes you feel as though this book is the holy grail. Let me tell you about some things I loved about this book. The book says the following :-> Fall in love with the process rather than the product. This is important because when you have a goal, it can be so daunting that you will be unhappy all along the journey to it and only getting the goal will make you stop feeling miserable. Dont wait to give yourself permission to be happy.-> It is not about a single accomplishment but it is about a cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Commit to process. The holy grail of havbit change is not a single 1% improvement but a whole bunch of them. It is a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of overall system.-> Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.-> Your identity is literally your repeated beingness.-> acknowledge need of action by saying things aloud-> stressed at work? take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile.I loved how the author does not berate you with a bunch of things you are doing wrong. Instead the author makes most of the pages in the book in explaining to you that if you are not succeeding perhaps you need to make several small changes that add to the aggregate work of your life.I think it has enthused in me infectious energy. It has been 10 days since the book ended but I have been taking more action at work. I have been taking more pains with my diet. I now track my calories. I have been to the gym way more regular. I know I can't afford to ever miss a workout and if I do, then it can't be missed for another day. Even if I go to gym for just 10 minutes the second day.The flaw in the book is how much it tries to stuff into one book.The flaw in the book is that despite being of moderate intelligence, I can't remember all the things and have to refer to the notes.I feel as though the whole book is a waste if the reader does not retain everything.However it is nearly impossible to retain all things in the book without considerable re-visits.That is a good thing. That is a bad thing.Also the cue, craving, response and reward - four laws of behavioural change concept is a complete fail on me.So there you have it. I read this book on paperback but found reading on my kindle and phone more effective. But the print is solid and very good.Also there is plenty of times in the book that the author writes the points he discussed in the chapters. So if you were not paying enough attention, guess what? you get one more chance.Go read it now.",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 6 September 2019,BRILLIANT WITH ONE FLAW.,4,,3

R3IRYNJ8Q24WWB,Prateek Dwivedi,"Many of you will find this book very simple and that's what the whole idea is about ,KEEP IT SIMPLE.In this book James talks about habits and that to very small habits which are not even worth noticing but will give you sudden results.When ever we want to start something new we always set a goal that seems to be un achievable ,for example if you want to loose weight you give your self a target of 5 kg or 10 kg and that seems to be very difficult so better start with half a kilo ,that might sound funny but with every half a kilo lost it will turn out to be 5 - 10 kg in few months and with every half a kilo lost you will feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in short run which you could not have experienced if your goal was 5 kg.Make it small make it easy make it attractive that's what the idea is about.One thing that I really liked the most is the concept of habit stacking . When ever you are starting something new don't plan a seperate time schedule for it but just stack it with your current habit.Example - When ever you are going to eat just do 2 pushups before that ,when ever you wake up in the morning just do 2 situps or meditate ,just before sleep read for 10 min etc.By applying this habit stacking I am able to exercise /meditate/read on a daily basis.It all started with 2 pushups to 20 ,from 2 situps to 40 ,from reading 10 min to hours of reading.--I was always lazy so I never exercise ,after reading this book I made it easy ,I fixed my exercise band to one leg of the bed so when ever I used to  go to sleep or I wake up in the morning or I pass by it- I exercise.--I was always eating like my moto was "" eat till you sleep"" so as the author says self control is very difficult for everyone to better make the things you want to avoid INVISIBLE ,so I gave away all the snacks and extra food stuff I had in my home and un installed food delivery apps and guess what it worked but yes you will still need some self control for not buying food stuff and installing food delivery apps.-- I was a social media addict always on my mobile so I made it DIFFICULT , uninstalled all the social media apps and before doing that temporarily disable my account.-- Had an habit of over spending and buying worth less stuff and just filling up the closest, so I pleaged not to spend a single penny untill and unless it's absolutely necessary and I started tracking my spendings on a daily basic.Smaller the target easier it is to achieve and more you do it ,it becomes a habit and habit transforms into big results. Just as every substance has a boiling point which is reached slowly and gradually after continuous heating ,so it needs to reach at a particular temperature before it boils,these small habbits are your continuous heating and sooner or later they will give you results ,Big Results.What changed for me after reading this book?1 I exercise daily and now I am in shape.2 I read on a daily basis.3 Binge eating almost stopped.4 More focused.Hope this helps..",Reviewed in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ on 28 October 2021,No matter how small but it counts.,5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cXhHrRsdL.jpg,14

R2FZZQIDMHBJBC,Sky Currents,This was a good book but it had way too much information for me to process. I went from feeling motivated and excited reading about the British cycling team to just wanting the book to be done towards the end.That being said I did find this book to be incredibly helpful.  As someone diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder ( a combo of schizophrenia and depression ) cleaning began to be so difficult for me. I tried to keep up but eventually I felt like I was losing the battle. My room made me so sad every time I walked into it. It didnâ€™t help that I moved from a bigger room with a bigger closet and more storage space for my stuff. I ended having things all over my bed with just a tiny spaced carved out for me to sleep. There were bags of clothes all over the floor. There were empty bottles or gallons of water everywhere. I just didn't have the motivation or mental energy to clean. I knew it would take at least a week to clean my room. Thanks to this book I realized like in the past just cleaning my room wasn't the problem it was my bad habits that was the problem.I would clean my room once every blue moon only to be met with the same problem. This time while it took a week to clean I have been able to keep my room clean by tidying up for about 5 to 10 minutes a day. This has removed such a stressor in my life. I would be close to tears walking into my room. Now I'm so proud to see a clean room.Also I picked up a habit of daily reading and walking. I still haven't been able to change my habits around cleaning the kitchen or the bathroom yet but I'm grateful for the progress.,Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 30 March 2023,Good book but too long for me.,4,,30

R2W3BGSAD0P54D,Yonni.I,"""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is a fantastic read that provides practical and actionable tips on how to make small but significant changes in your life. Clear emphasises the importance of focusing on the small habits and decisions that we make every day and how these can compound over time to produce life-changing results.The book presents a range of strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones, such as the Two Minute Rule and Habit Stacking. Clear also draws from psychology and neuroscience to explain why these techniques work and how they can help us achieve our goals.While some readers may find the book repetitive, the message is clear: small habits lead to big results. I found the tips in the book handy and have already started implementing some of them into my daily routine. Overall, I would highly recommend ""Atomic Habits"" to anyone looking to make positive changes in their life.

For me, it was transforming from a size 16 to a size 10 with 8 months of small habit changes. Now, I am applying the same concepts to my business. I look forward to seeing the results I WILL achieve at the end of this year!",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 3 March 2023,MUST READ if you want lasting results!!,5,,0
R1DGTCWTUIC9BN,Phil,"Atomic Habits reviewâ€œGet 1% better every dayâ€.I am slightly biased in writing this review because prior to reading the book I already possessed a near religious belief in habits and how they impact our lives. Having read previous habit books like Charles Duhigg Power of Habits and Marshall Goldsmith â€œtriggersâ€, I felt I was at least relatively intermediate on my knowledge of the topic.Why did I read the book then? Because learning (or reinforcing learning) about habits is one of the most powerful ways for you to improve in the game of life. Your habits shape your destiny is one of my core beliefs so I am always happy to try to get a new â€œedgeâ€ or ways to improve them. I alsoexpected to find new gems that would help reinforce the message of why habits are so powerful and I was not disappointed.But enough of my own habits and life, the question is whether you should read this book? The resounding answer is YES.Honestly, who doesnâ€™t want to get better at something? Or who doesn't want to stop doing something?James Clear is a fantastic writer who I have followed his informative articles on a variety of topics for nearly a year. A lot of what is in the book is material he has written about on his website as other reviewers have stated but he puts it together in a very neat format for the book so even his regular readers should get something out of this. I actually took so many notes/highlights from the Kindle edition that I almost reached the publisher limit of 10% - a sign that I believe highly in what I am reading and want to reflect upon it for years to come.The opening pages of the book lay down a quote I will now repeat forever â€œif you can get 1% better each day for one year, youâ€™ll end up thirty- seven times better by the time youâ€™re done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, youâ€™ll decline nearly down to zero.â€ The beginning lays out why habits are so powerful and how habits shape who we are as people before getting into the HOW of starting to build better habits.The core of the book is based on the authorâ€™s â€œ4 Lawsâ€ of habit change - Make it obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfyingâ€. By following the laws of habit creation we improve our chances of success in creating new habits.Without droning on too long, I must highly recommend this book. Even if you have no idea about what a habit is or if you are already advanced in the practising of habit change then this book will still teach you so much. If not just a refresher on the topic to keep you motivated. Seriously, anyone of any age could benefit from this book. It gives you the tools to start thinking more clearly about your life and improving it. I would recommend it to anyone over the other habit books I have read (see above) as it is relatively short and provides the â€œhow toâ€ parts on a silver platter.I will end my post on a few excellent quotes of the book towards the end (Ch.19 â€How to Stay Motivatedâ€ as this is the golden question for once you finish the book. A coach was asked by Clear what is the difference between the best athletes and everyone else? The coach said: â€˜the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasnâ€™t expecting: â€œAt some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.â€â€œMastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.It is a fantastic book but the key thing will be can you then translate that into action? The book gives you the best leg up you can get - itâ€™s then up to you to turn knowledge into action and go and get 1% better every darn day.",Reviewed in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º on 8 December 2018,Get 1% Better Everyday,5,,78

RKS50MWXYJS0,Robert â€˜Bobâ€™ Macespera,"The ""Atomic Habits"" has become almost a constant presence in the best seller's books, both sides of the Atlantic - including an astonishing 150 weeks in the prestigious New York Times Best Seller List. Still recently published (in 2018) the book comes now with a small red note on the cover: ""Over three million copies sold!"" Is that all deserved? Is it such a good book?No, if you think of the many books published in the last four years that do deserve more copies sold or to stay in the NYT Best Seller List longer than this one - I could name a few far better books published only one or two months back. But reflections on the market and quality and best-selling charts and sales apart, this is a good book, well written, non-academical, simple, practical and that has managed to find a niche of readers in these hectic, social-media-crazy days and that has touched an obvious nerve. In this field, it's a good book that deserves praise - and to be read.One of its many merits, as I mentioned above, is that's very practical - it has good and ready examples of ways to improve efficiency and work; and in the way, to feel better. The author has also an obvious talent for expressing abstract notions with just a few words. His main theory, the ""cue-craving-response-reward"", while not life-changing is at the very least intriguing and looks easy to put in place and to be used as a blueprint for daily routines. The author tries and manages to get to his audience through simplicity - ""I knew it, but I never knew how to describe it"" is what the reader will say often throughout the text. In this sense is quite similar to another best seller of the self-help milieu: Dr Julie Smith's ""Why has nobody told me this before"", a far better, deeper book that manages also to reach and help its readers quite effortlessly, and that also has managed to sell in vast amounts. And, to complete the triad of current worthy self-help books, do try also ""Can't Hurt Me"", by David Goggings, rather different in tone, but very good too, and also funnier. (I've reviewed these two books in this platform).On the minus side, perhaps the text tries sometimes too hard in being too easy and becomes too basic, almost to the point of looking patronizing. For instance, with the advice on how to use less a mobile phone: by putting it in the next room. The book falls a few times for examples of this sort, too over-simplistic, as if it was addressing an audience of 7 to 12 years old.Also a flaw, and this one is directed to the publisher, it is obvious the effort in trying to present the book as much larger than it actually is. The book is crowded with charts, blank pages, short bullet points, sentences taking a whole page, etc. It has 270 pages and without all those wasted spaces it should have been 70 or 100 pages less, but then it would look ""short"", something the publisher obviously tried to avoid (it happens a lot nowadays), as if a book is better for being thicker or longer.So all and all, a good book that's far from life-changing, but in which everyone will find a few practical tips for everyday life; nothing more, but nothing less than that.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 18 October 2022,"A good, practical book",4,,92

But I chose to take my time with it, reading up to 5 chapters at a time, applying what is being shared, doing a weekly reflection on what I read through journaling and notes and sharing what Iâ€™m learning to clients/ close friends and of course applying the authors tools/suggestions. Itâ€™s the first day of February 2023 but I can proudly say I went all of January without hitting the snooze button on my phone, waking up at 5am every morning, making my bed, unplugging from technology/social media by 10pm and asleep by 11. Habits I had lost track of over the years of being plagued with insomnia, trauma and difficult life transitions.

R2LH67VNF529U4,Sean G,"Iâ€™ve read several books on habits and this is by far the best. The author packs the book with lots of useful nuggets and methods around habit formation and change. His main thesis is that very small habits that help reinforce a strong identity will compound over time and lead to meaningful changes.The author suggests that most people see habits as the necessary means to some specific goal or event, after which the habit may cease to be meaningful. He calls these â€œoutcome-basedâ€ habits. However, instilling habits that resonate and fortify a personal identity, such as â€œathleteâ€ or â€œhealth nutâ€, etc. are much more likely to stick and accumulate. These habits he calls â€œidentity-basedâ€.He focuses on â€œsystemsâ€ over â€œhabitsâ€. Systems drive behavior and beliefs drive systems. He talks about how our language often reflects our beliefs and how making small changes in how we describe ourselves can have outsized effects on our identity and behavior. Ex: A recently former smoker is offered a cigarette and says â€œno thanks, Iâ€™m trying to quitâ€ reflects an identity that still sees themselves as a smoker as opposed to someone who may respond â€œNo thanks, Iâ€™m not a smokerâ€.The author introduces concepts such as â€œThe Plateau of Latent Potentialâ€ and â€œThe Valley of Disappointmentâ€ which describe the gap between expected short-term results and actual, delayed results. Early progress is often hard to measure and therefore often not obvious, when in fact changes are happening beneath the surface as your brain and body slowly rewire. This latent progress can demotivate us as our expectations often donâ€™t match what we see or feel.Like most other good books on habits, the author spends time explaining the â€˜habit loopâ€ process of Cue, Crave, Routine, and Reward. He emphasizes how architecting oneâ€™s environment to help reinforce positive cues is far more effective than relying on willpower and motivation. Our environment is the most powerful influencer of our habits.The author also presents several examples of the power of just showing up. He calls this the â€œTwo Minute Ruleâ€. At the beginning of habit formation, whatâ€™s most important is simply showing up. Many people wonâ€™t start a new habit because they view the habit as being large and daunting. But reducing the new behavior to just 2-minutes, and only 2-minutes, can help ease you into the routine. Other concepts include Habit Stacking, Habit Tracking, and Accountability Partners.Overall I found the book enlightening, engaging, and well written.

R37F9SBKLBFW7S,JustinHoca,"I have subscribed to the author's email newsletters for years as I find them both motivating and helpful. His book is similar but is not a rehashed compilation of his emails-- he has actually done a decent amount of research. His biography is also very revealing, having overcome physical hurdles to achieve athletic goals as well as adopting a mindset in college that was different from his peers and allowed him to succeed in the classroom. Clear definitely has some mix of nature and nurture that makes him both intellectually curious and tenacious.To achieve a goal, focus on the habit(s) that help you achieve that goal instead of being fixated on the goal itself. Make performing those habits as easy and natural as possible.""Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?""""Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.This is the secret to self-control.""One challenge I took away from this book is to get into the practice of ""habit stacking,"" setting habits to be performed one after the other:""I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].The habit stacking formula is: 'After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].'""For example, I have a vague goal of doing more pull-ups. I hung a chin-up bar on a door that I walk past frequently. I have a rule: Every time I walk by the door I do one more pull-up than I did before. A good habit-stacking routine might be to think about one thing I'm thankful for after every pull-up routine. Or to also do one more push-up than I did before. Or, since I have a stack of thank you notes I need to write, I write a thank-you note after every pull-up set.""Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.""""Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.""Once I start doing pull-ups, I become a guy who exercises-- who does pull-ups. Pull-ups are a challenge for many people, so I can start to develop an identity that I do challenging things.The author also talks about the importance of making such habits pleasurable. Maybe I have a reward that if I do 15 pull-ups in a day, I'll let myself check Facebook. Seeing ""likes"" on Facebook posts gives me a rush of dopamine. The dopamine becomes the reward from my having done 15 pull-ups.""It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds.""This book helps you get where you want to be by helping you establish routines where you are today. Focus on the habit and eventually you'll find you've arrived at your goal.4.5 stars out of 5. As a caveat, I find these types of habit books more readily embraced by men than women. My observation is that men have an easier time being rote in their habits; eating the same meals every day (requiring the same preparation, same shopping list, same routine every time). This book had a rather un-emotional feel to it like many other books by men talking about habits and optimization (ie: Tim Ferriss).",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 13 September 2019,Focus on the habit and the goal will follow,4,,17

R3GE0XGP30NH2Z,James,"""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is a must-read for anyone looking to improve their life through small, consistent actions. Clear presents a compelling argument that success is the result of many small, seemingly insignificant actions, and that even the smallest change in behavior can lead to significant improvements over time.He provides practical strategies for developing habits, including how to create a system of habits that work together, how to overcome obstacles and setbacks, and how to stick to good habits even in the face of temptations.The book is well-written, insightful, and easy to understand, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to make positive changes in their life.

RFJAY6E1CN2XD,Poolestep,"Some useful ideas and tips but some of the techniques would not appeal to all personality types. By definition, this book is about introducing incremental changes. It would also appeal to those who are comfortable with structure and detailed planning. Thatâ€™s great for many but not all. Interestingly, James briefly covers personality traits and differences in this book but completely ignores this aspect.As with many self-help books, there is a lot of repetition and summarising and so a 300 page book could have been condensed to about 50 pages which made it a tedious read. As with a few other reviewers, I was miffed to find the last two chapters required me to give my email address away. There are not many best selling novels out there that cut the story short two chapters from the end and insist on your giving your email address before giving you the ending!

I guess it is pride in your new identity that makes it possible to stopping slipping back into bad old ways.

Yet the core ideas of the book are good and a powerful way to organize your approach (in actions and thought) to self improvement. Less psychology, more about measuring and optimizing the small actions you consistently take. e.g. you'll feel like a writer when you write every day.If it were 30 pages long, would be a five star book. Instead as is typical of this style of book, you get all kinds of redundant examples, self references and marketing, etc. It's pretty typical in self help, but IMHO if your struggling to make big changes in life its a good book to read through once.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 2 September 2022,Great framework for self improvement,4,,3

R3L1OFEH7LXN1A,Harry,"I've read a ton of non-fiction and business minded books and they all seem to have the secret to getting more out of your life, your business, your relationships, etc. That's all well and good, but the most effective changes - coincidentally - may in fact take the least amount of brainpower. They come in the form of habits, ways our brain have been wired to do things naturally and without thinking, and more importantly, small, daily or near-daily actions that trigger reward centers in our brain.Unfortunately, most of the habits we possess or continue to do are unhealthy or destructive. I.e. chewing nails, eating junk food, or just coming home and watching TV or mindlessly browsing YouTube or scrolling through Instagram. We do these things not because we're weak willed or lazy (most of the time), but because they're the easiest habits to fall into. They're specifically designed and tailored to affect the reward centers of our brain and deliver scheduled shots of dopamine, thus turning them into habits that are hard to kick.Atomic Habits, in a brilliant and knowledgeable way I think, breaks down the ways we can actually achieve more by doing less. And by less, I mean having to expend less effort in willpower, pain, or sacrifice than we're lead to believe. A perfect example in this book is this dancer (I'm forgetting her name) who's world renown and a master of her craft, and who doesn't have to remind herself to go to the gym every day. She instead views the act of going to the gym as walking out her door and hailing a cab to the gym. Once she's done that, everything else takes care of itself. So the habit is not working out, expending sweat, effort, and feeling tired or worn out, which is what many of us find challenging. All she has to do is hail that cab, and she's done, because once she's there she begins to work out. The difference is small, but releases this ability to get that daily workout in which is essential to her success.That's one example of many in this book that challenges one's thinking of how to be successful and create good habits. It's easy to believe it's all a matter of will, of getting motivated, of working off a spark of passion, etc. The truth it is has much more to do with routine, pleasure, familiarity, and route action. I highly recommend this book.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 25 February 2019,"Great book, insightful and actionable",5,,1

We would improve our bodies, minds, economics, our families, communities, and our country.  The processes in this book, give a practical methodology to changing your habits, and making more rational decisions that are based on the identity / person we want to become.  If was can understand the Laws of Good Habit Building (Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, and Satisfying).  For breaking bad habits (Make it Obscure, Ugly, Difficult, and Painful), you can also combine the two to help motivate you in the right direction.

Second, it allows for greater understanding of the ""Effects of accumulation results of marginal gains""  If you can improve 1% per week, in a year, you will have improved over 50% which means a fundamental change in who you are in most cases.  You have to set up systems to achieve your goals.  Prepare of unforeseen challenges that LIFE will throw at you.  Prepare three meals at one time, so you only have ONE major clean up instead of three.  Have mini meals ready so when you are hungry, you still stay on plan for your total caloric intake for the day.  It's NOT the goals, but the systems you setup for yourself that determine your success.  When you are about to make a poor food choice, you can ask yourself, ""Would a health person eat this?""

R25YMN2475T7UK,Brad Revell,"Over the past few years I have been an avid reader of James Clearâ€™s posts and emails. His blogs and other articles have provided me with a solid structure and framework on habit building thereby driving both achievement and fulfilment in everything I do in life. Whether it is healthy eating, hitting the gym, or keeping my focus in the work environment his advice, tools and approaches have greatly benefited me.I was fortunate enough to get a pre-release copy of Atomic Habits and jumped straight into it. It isnâ€™t a long read, however, it is structured in a way that provides a good overview of why habits are important, tools and techniques on how to establish habits as well as a plethora of real life examples. James also makes reference to an additional set of tools on the Atomic Habits website which you can also leverage (e.g. habit trackers, cheat sheets, guides etc.)The book centres on the both on the four stages of developing a habit and the laws of behaviour change. The latter he delves into in great detail, again with many examples on how to apply within your own life given constraints. The book had a nice pace and balance on theory and application.The biggest thing I have learned (also from his blogs) is the difference between goals and habits. For example, instead of setting a goal, create an identity and establish small habits that align to that identity. For example, donâ€™t say you want to lose weight, but rather identify with being a healthy person that exercises most days and eats well. The habits might be drinking x amount of water a day, 10 push-ups a day, walking 10,000 steps per day etc; and increase the habits once they are firmly established.Given the applicability of this topic, it is a book everyone should read. Unfortunately there are many key areas we donâ€™t get educated on at school. This is one area that is important for life in everything that we do. Highly recommend Atomic Habits!Three key takeaways from the book:1. Habit stacking. Put your clothes out next to your bed before going to sleep so that when you wake up it is the first thing you do or think about. That habit will then drive the habit to go to the gym etc.2. Look to establish identity habits versus reaching for goals or developing finite habits. Habits based on beliefs are much more powerful.3. When it comes to wanting to do something (good or bad) 90% of the dopamine release is driven by the desire versus and 10% on the actual experience.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 17 October 2018,One of the best books I have read in 2018!

But I did find the presentation of the material here very clear and very persuasive - and it might actually lead to changes in my life  - where previous reading about habits has simply added to my stock of knowledge.Particularly interesting, and particularly easy to implement are the thoughts that: it's helpful to take stock of habits and think what you want to do about them (after all you've acquired them rather randomly through life), and that it's fairly easy to do something about them - form intentions that are linked to 'cues' or times and places (rather than just vague intentions) and reflect on what it's very easy to do to get a habit going - read one page of a book at bedtime for example, not a chapter, and find habits that themselves bring rewards (find a nice flavour of toothpaste for example)...and it's also good on bad habits (mostly: avoid cues, like returning Vietnam vets avoided Vietnam cues - or you might keep alcohol or high sugar drinks out of the house)...There's a bit of helpful overall encouragement too - small changes to habits can add up to big changes in your life...And some further material that while interesting (for example a comparison of the physiques of swimmers and middle distance runners) seems a little set apart from the main themes of the book...Sometimes you might question the analysis (is over-eating really because we are suckers for high fat high sugar foods due to our genes, or is it that 'we need protein and will eat till we get it' as for example in the book Eat Like The Animals - which is an interesting variant on this theme)....Overall, though, strongly recommended.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 1 January 2021,very persuasive presentation of mostly familiar material,5,,4

REWBAE88YBJIV,David,"Excellent book this, and it should definitely be on everyoneâ€™s â€œmust readâ€ list. The concepts arenâ€™t difficult or even that new but what makes it different from other similar books in the genre is the astute linkage with real world human psychology. James shows how habit formation is central to how humans operate and why, as a result, it is easy to slip into bad ones. You then get a practical blueprint about how to change them and form new ones in a way which actually works. Iâ€™ve put it into practice and already feel stronger, more energised, and more focussed than I  have in a long time, because I know I will just keep on getting better and better.

R17H7XA8F5OX3C,LTJ,"â€œAtomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Onesâ€by James Clear is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their career, life, or how they can turn their bad habits into good ones. As a person who is very organized and detailed when it comes to work, life, and recreation before reading this book, I learned many valuable techniques to continue working on my own atomic habits.I loved the graphs used throughout this book as it helps to visualize how impactful habits are and why itâ€™s important to stick with them over time. It was also great to read the real-life stories around athletes, celebrities, and even comedians on how having good habits and building upon them are truly a recipe for continued growth and maintaining long-term success.I give â€œAtomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Onesâ€by James Clear a 5/5 as this book has definitely helped me and countless others when it comes to good habits.

R1HI1KMCKL5UY5,Eric J. Drysdale,"Although a large percentage of the 2300 plus books I have read since January 2000 are audio, mostly from Audible, I feel this is a case where you need a print edition.  With non-fiction books I like to mark the margin in pencil to identify key points, then create my own index, and that is certainly the case here.  Although James provides a chapter summary, which is most useful, the items that have relevance for you are worth noting.  James kindly sent me chapter 1, as he no doubt did to tens of thousands on his mailing list.  I found this most interesting and prompted me to buy two copies (one to loan to friends) in due course.  On reflection it occurred to me that there are 1440 minutes in the day, 1% being 14.4 minutes.  Round that up to 15 minutes â€“ a quarter of an hour.  All of us can devote 1% a day to a desired project, and over time that adds up.  I decided that apart from whatever else I was doing in the writing field, preparing my novel THE PRICE TO PAY and a collection of 25 short stories â€“ THE FORK IN THE ROAD â€“ to go on Kindle, etc. I would devote 1% a day to writing a new short story.  Consequently, since the end of October 2018 I have written 8 stories with a word count of a bit over 38,000 words.  I do acknowledge that when the creative process is upon me and I am nearing the end I might get up at 4:30 am and write for a couple of hours, but it has been an excellent discipline.  I believe that anyone who wants to improve their productivity, refine the process by which they achieve this and become more efficient in achieving your goals, ATOMIC HABITS is a book to read, then read again and again.  Thank you James for your excellent â€˜Giving Attitudeâ€™ â€“ you deserve all your success and are entitled to enjoy both the tangible and the intangible moments as you pass the markers along Success Road.Eric J Drysdale â€“ em:  ericjdrysdale@gmail.com",Reviewed in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º on 24 March 2019,Tiny Changes - Consistent Application and Discipline - No Limits!,5,,29

R2IF8NU4YVJM93,Kindle Customer,"8/10Atomic Habits is a useful book. Itâ€™s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. Itâ€™s something you can actually put into practice in your life.I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material.I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesnâ€™t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. Itâ€™s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.This book is worth reading. Itâ€™s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesnâ€™t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an air-tight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit.Iâ€™m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best Iâ€™ve read because itâ€™s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things heâ€™s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesnâ€™t detract from the book. He expands on most things heâ€™s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you donâ€™t really get from the newsletter.The intro is pretty graphic. Itâ€™s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that.

There is no ""find yourself, be one with the habit"" rubbish that people seem to be talking about; there are lots of scientific and academic references to back up what he is saying. Each step of creating a new habit (or destroying an old one) is broken down and an example from business or sport is given to add  emphasis to why this is relevant, a credible example.I have not thought about my bad habits in the way presented in this book and i will definitely be using its tools too remove my old habits and create new ones.

R33VLQVR7F5BZH,Lia,"Though well-written, this book seems to be more of a rather premature autobiography of a 20-something year old wealthy white male.Granted, he has overcome some first-world adversity, but I found the underlying message to be repetitive and better suited to teenagers or young adults who lack drive and direction.The underlying message, over and over (and over) is to persist with positive behaviours and they will eventually become a habit.It is well-studied that if you repeat an action 27 days in a row, it becomes a habit. That is the general crux of this book and I thought this was something most people already knew.It also appeared to me that the author has lived quite a privileged life and doesn't seem to yet understand what lifelong adversity is via lower to middle-class cards most of us are dealt in life, so if you are 30+ and have suffered many setbacks in life because you didn't win the 'family lottery', you will likely find this book mildly irritating.I personally found this book useless as I do not lack drive or ambition at all and unfortunately can't relate to a wealthy high-school jock who hurt himself playing a notoriously dangerous sport.I'll probably keep it for when my son starts reading novels.",Reviewed in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º on 25 September 2022,Found the underlying message irritatingly repetitive,3,,22

RWRDF81PWZ2AO,Eric Lee,"As I write this, Atomic Habits has spent 85 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list in the category â€˜Advice, How-To and Miscellaneousâ€™. This is extraordinary, and out of curiosity I decided to try it.James Clear is not a scientist, though heâ€™s a self-declared expert on habits, and my first impression of the book as I read about a childhood accident he had, his experience as a baseball player and businessman, was not a good one. But the book grew on me.He writes well, he cites good sources (all footnoted), he sums up his main points at the end of every (very short) chapter, and the book makes sense.The basic point â€“ made by him and others who write about this field â€“ seems to be to make small changes, be consistent, and over time youâ€™ll get results.If youâ€™re struggling with the examples he frequently cites â€” you want to lose weight, read more books, do better in your profession, etc. â€” this book is not a bad place to start.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 16 July 2021,The book makes sense,4,,0

R22ORSR0WEOHVB,Elena Chen,"I honestly didn't have many expectations when I bought this book to find out what the fuss was about --- all these high ratings and strong reviews. I can say I've been pleasantly surprised.I'll be revisiting and rereading the book from time to time because there's so much in there to absorb and implement. Some may find it overwhelming, particularly if they're feeling they need to instil many habits with a limited amount of time, as the book is detailed and isn't about quick fixes. A delve into the fascinating psychological underpinnings of our habits combined with an actionable guide implementing habits you would like to do more of and lessening the habits you would like to stay away from. It isn't a one size fits all solution, so taking the time to understand why things that are working work well, and the things that don't stick with us is important. The author has really put in the effort to share his expertise on habits in a way that is digestible and informative. Given the complexity of human beings, it's no wonder it takes a whole book just to get into habit formation. The book stays illuminating til the end.Well worth the purchase, will be a staple in my library whose many wise ideas I'll be sharing with others.

R3NBBLKSOCU9RJ,Adam,"Like many of his contemporaries, James Clear is here re-framing ideas that have always been with us, a combination of ancient philosophy and modern science.  Commonly called 'self-help', another collective term of these works may be the genre of 'Intentionality.'  Intentional living, being purposeful, and having a system to embed that purpose, to achieve a dynamic momentum that will propel you forward.Here the system is about noticing the triggers in our lives for good and bad behaviours, and being intentional about them.  Building on them.  So you build motivators onto and generate the triggers that are good for you and improve you.  You make the bad triggers as intentionally as unpleasant as possible.  The titular 'Atomic Habits' are the small things that on their own are negligible, but cumulatively, to borrow a key phrase from this book, they stack up, and tip the scales, one way or another.  James Clear here gives us a system to help us tip the scales in our favour.Like many of this genre chapters are introduced with various hard won paths to success of those who have excelled at their craft, be that sports, business, science, arts.  We then dig into the moral of their story and a new feature of the habits system is explored.  Each chapter ends with a bullet point summing up.The book's soul is with behavioural science.  It is a very 'bio-mechanical' view of life and endeavour that lacks mystery and real profundity.  It's all rather clinical.Still, it's like watching a Ted talk where the person's breathless delivery at least makes you listen.  And we can all do with a bit of extra intentionality.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 18 May 2021,From the acorn....,3,,6

RR5GUSYSBKQZ0,John Richards,"Clear provides the reader with some practical ways to build and maintain habits. I especially like that he provides four clear ways to build and maintain good habits, while offering four ways to break bad habits we all tend to build over time. A few other takeaways for me. First, the importance of habit stacking. Clear suggests building habits in a way that one action triggers another. Bedtime routines are an example of this. I have implemented this in my own routine and it has been helpful. The chapter that discussed building in accountability for your habits was also helpful. Though the example he provided was extreme (a guy entered a pretty stringent â€œcontractâ€ with his wife and trainer), I can see how accountability can help with habits.

RGA2O7JXDO0PE,Alex Pesaro,"I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it as I suspected either: 1) a repetitive farrago of cheesy platitudes, or: 2) â€˜inspiringâ€™ success stories of people naturally endowed with tremendous willpower, steely resolve, and steadfast belief in oneâ€™s own worth. On the contrary, this approach is at the same time practical, grounded in science, and eminently â€˜humanâ€™. With â€˜humanâ€™ I mean based on a solid, deeply emphatic understanding of the way ordinary people think, act, and make mistakes, not on ideal, out-of-reach models.Hereâ€™s the nub of it: change doesnâ€™t necessary start with a powerful resolution or a clean cut, it may well be the incremental effect of minuscule (hence the title) adjustments in the way we go about with our daily lives. Improvement is the outcome of a gradual and methodical process of removing what doesnâ€™t work and replacing it with more effective habits. Small, sustained changes can have big future impacts.Mind you. Thereâ€™s nothing 100% original in the book, but the way the material is presented is good: eminently readable; practical, and nicely organised in short chapters. Some methods are surprisingly clever, can be implemented in no time, and look effective.

Everything I mentioned above, I started doing it for no more than 5 minutes a day, and then I just add it a minute every month.

R1WY1FSMYVQZ0G,Poonam Advani,"I chanced upon James Clearsâ€™ blog on a random Google search for my â€œNext Book to Readâ€. After checking his list of recommendations, I read a few of his posts and I was hooked. The writing was easy to read and understand, his research thorough and reading his posts felt like having a personal life coach cheering you from afar.When I saw Atomic Habits listed on his website, I was very keen to read it. Fast forward 6 months, I finally purchased the kindle version and I am thrilled with it. The book follows his usual style of writing â€“ which is crisp, easy to read and packs a punch. There are actionable insights in the book, that when implemented consistently, can bring about significant changes in our lives. No task seems too big to achieve â€“ ask anyone who has tried building a new habit or deleting an old one from their lives, how difficult it is to keep at it for 21 days or 60 or 90 (depending on which literature youâ€™re reading). But the methods listed in this book can allow you to overcome failure just as easily as they encourage you to successfully implement new habits.The ideas listed in the book are forgiving and generous, quite literally, where some ask you to focus on incremental gains, some donâ€™t reprimand you for missing one day of a new diet / workout schedule, others give you simple, straightforward suggestions to increase your chances of success in implementing new habits.Thereâ€™s no long story, scientific jargon, unnecessary fillers or flimsy writing to make you NOT want to turn the page.

RYDZOG4JE7BS9,Parker Street,"Updated review: decent but seriously overhyped, this book is a watered-down, distorted shadow of Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg.  If this book is from the Stone Age, then Tiny Habits is from the Space Age.  Neither book is complete, because the important roles of motivation and neurophysiology are not discussed sufficiently at all.  There are critically important, yet subtle points about the behavior change process that Clear misses in Atomic Habits but that Fogg emphasizes in Tiny Habits.  Tiny Habits is far more elegant, more concise, and presents a self-contained system that's effective and universal and also explains anything in Clear's book more neatly than Clear presents it himself.  If you have to choose between this book and Tiny Habits, I strongly recommend reading and using Tiny Habits instead.  Even if you've read this book, you should read Tiny Habits to pick up what you've missed out on here and to really calibrate your behavior-change system.  Atomic Habits smacks of being written by a motivational writer with a strong interest in habits who decided to cash in on his large email list with a book deal, while Tiny Habits is written by an actual behavior researcher and educator who actually trained tens of thousands of people in his technique before deciding to write a book.  The only way in which Atomic Habits is superior to Tiny Habits is in its discussion of meta-habits (see the section on annual and semiannual reviews).  But even that stuff is freely available online in podcasts and blogs.  I couldn't pick out a single original idea in this book.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 13 June 2020,A distorted shadow of Tiny Habits,3,,109

R2WMAN05O3RV9S,BartmanSA,"This book just might be the most important book you ever read.We all know what we need to do to be successful but we don't do it. Why? We have the wrong habits. We surf the net when we know we should be starting the company we know we can. We eat candy when we know we should be eating something healthily... and so on. By why do we do these things we know are wrong? And why don't we do the things we know are right? Because we have the wrong habits. I used to think that will power was something you either had innately or you didn't. The author clearly explains that this is not true. Will power is more about your environment than anything innate. He also explains how to change your environment to get rid of bad habits and instil new, good ones. I read this book a week ago and it has already changed my life. Read it, summarise it and re-read the summary. Treat it like a book you have to master for university exams.

R3MKU6MBLGHX00,Curiosity,"Das Buch beginnt mit einer kurzen EinfÃ¼hrung, und einer Schilderung welche die BeweggrÃ¼nde des Autors nÃ¤her beleuchtet. Danach kommt er zÃ¼gig zum Punkt und man wird mit hilfreichen Modellen und Methoden vertraut gemacht, die einem dabei helfen sollen nÃ¼tzliche Gewohnheiten zu etablieren und schlechte Angewohnheiten auszumustern.Das Ganze wird mit Fallbeispielen und Anekdoten ausgeschmÃ¼ckt, und dazwischen gibts jede Menge Ã¼bersichtliche Tabellen, Zusammenfassungen und konkrete Handlungsanweisungen. Ich persÃ¶nlich fand die Balance dabei angemessen.Die vorgestellten Konzepte klingen vielversprechend, und laden zum ausprobieren ein. Vor allem die kleinen Kniffe um ins Tun zu kommen sind meines Erachtens besonders hilfreich, und erhÃ¶hen die Chance durchzuhalten bis ein angestrebtes Verhalten sich als Teil der PersÃ¶nlichkeit manifestiert hat.Perfektion ist dabei nicht notwendig. Vielmehr zeigt sich, dass ein durchdachtes System von Gewohnheiten an sich ein mÃ¤chtiges Werkzeug ist, mit dem Vieles mÃ¶glich wird, sofern man dranbleibt. SchlieÃŸlich bringen einen auch kleine Schritte dem Ziel nÃ¤her.Um bei der Verfolgung von VorsÃ¤tzen und guten Absichten nicht die Orientierung bzw. die Motivation zu verlieren, kÃ¶nnen die Ideen aus diesem Buch sicher einen wertvollen Beitrag leisten.

When he announced that he is going to write a book about habits, I got really excited.It is the first book I ever read this year and it was perfect. It's what I needed.The difference with this book from the others is that there are a lot of ACTIONABLE steps that are provided. Seriously... it's not just a one kind of way to do things, but it's about finding what will work for you in your lifestyle.I got the hard copy first, and when I got done reading the book, I got a kindle version as well for reference. After all, this not a one and done book. It's something that you can go back to over and over.I'll go out of my way by saying that if you want a book about HABITS, this is the only one you really need. You can go read the other popular books if you want to have a lot of scientific explanation, but this book offers enough of that already but more of actionable steps.

R1TVTZUR9MF9Q4,Julian Murrell,"Â I am a business owner from Berlin, Germany. I profited a lot from this book. In this short review, I'd like to highlight just three concepts from the book.First, the author says that habits are the compound interest of self improvement. Many people give up a long time before they can experience the compound effect of their efforts. So when going after a worthwile goal, then what is needed is a lot of patience and perseverence.Second, the author says it's good to have goals but it's so much better to have a system and concentrate on executing the system instead. Because if we do just that, we can be happy every time we execute our plan.Third, identity change is the fastest way to get what we want in life.Instead of saying: ""I want to work out three times a week"" we could be saying: ""I am an athletic person"" or instead of saying ""I want to write a book"" we should be saying to ourselves: ""I am an author"" - because what does an author do? He writes. It's really as easy as that.",Reviewed in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on 12 January 2021,These three concepts have helped me achieve my goals a lot faster,5,,27

R2IR2CG2RVFTEC,Kim Olbrich,"This is a great book. I have found it the best and most useful book on Habits I have read so far. One of the aha helpful things was the idea that you must first establish your identity, and then the habit (behaviour) reinforces that. Rather than tying to do it the other way around. Viz (quoting from the book): ""Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change, you are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.""  And ""It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins."" and finally to reinforce this point ""The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become"".Also, the author has developed a clear framework called 'The Four Laws of Behavior Change"" which provides a simple set of rules (laws) for creating good habits and breaking bad habits. And you are taken step by step through each law, given plenty of practical examples, and there is a summary at the end of each chapter which reinforces the main learning points.Thanks for writing this book Mr James Clear!

And itâ€™s powerful stuff.Donâ€™t be fooled by the topic â€” â€œhabitsâ€ sounds a bit dreary.But the book is not about figuring out how to plod through life, getting rid of those pesky habits like smoking and getting better at good habits like eating your vegetables.Itâ€™s about figuring out what you want to do within your time constraints â€” what you want to do with your life â€” and setting up systems that improve your chances of becoming the person you want to be.So buy it, read it, study it, and make these simple techniques part of your life. Theyâ€™re kinda fun â€” and thereâ€™s no telling how far your habits will take you.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 17 October 2018,Achieving more with less effort,5,,3

R3J2QOJ0575CKQ,Linda W.,"International Bestseller, Atomic Habits: an easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones by James Clear is filled with the best science on personal growth and success. Also on the cover, it says, â€œTiny changes, remarkable results.â€Mr. Clearâ€™s premise is that only making a 1 percent improvement each day compounds to make remarkable results over time.In each chapter, Clear cites scientific research that points out these principles and how to break oneâ€™s goals down into micro-goals and tasks that are manageable into 2-minute time frames and stacked with oneâ€™s current habits in order to cement the new practice with something thatâ€™s already done habitually subconsciously.Overall, I found this book very helpful in how to take baby steps to transform my life â€“ in any and all areas of my life. I consider it a â€˜keeper,â€™ that I will refer to over and over as I implement these suggestions.I highly recommend this book for anyone whoâ€™s a student of personal growth or business success.",Reviewed in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ on 7 May 2021,filled with the best science on personal growth and success,5,,1
RSQBWY5OECYKG,SJ@Florida,"Like others who have written reviews I have followed James Clear since he started his blog and find his style of writing appealing because itâ€™s â€œclearâ€ (no pun intended), pragmatic and believable because he has â€œclearlyâ€ (again, no pun intended) done his homework and thoroughly researched the ideas he presents. Also, like other reviewers, I have read A LOT about habits, behavior change and Iâ€™m familiar with premises behind the tiny changes and habit stacking models. When James announced his book release I was excited for his accomplishment and admittedly a bit dubious about what new idea could he possibly add.  I like this guy and he does practice what he preaches but what else can you add to developing positive habits thatâ€™s not already been said. Well, after reading Atomic Habits I can honestly say that James Clear has not only added quite a lot but did so in an engaging, enjoyable manner that includes relevant stories and examples.  If you are seeking to change or improve habits then please do yourself a favor and read this book.  Seriously you wonâ€™t need all the other books because this one has covered an exhaustive amount of research and makes it easy for you to understand how to change your habits (hint: itâ€™s not you â€”itâ€™s your system)",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 19 October 2018,Can anything new possibly be said about how to change or develop positive habits?

R3BKR01F6FFLGR,Skew,"Honestly, I'm grown sick of the number of self-help books that I've downloaded, only to find that the key message can be written in a couple of lines, and the rest of the book is taken up with padding out the point.Atomic Habits doesn't do that. It doesn't make grandiose visionary statements, or adopt the ""just do it"" warrior philosophy. Instead it draws on evidence and practices designed to improve human performance. And instead of focusing on how to be better by pretending to be someone else, it shows you how to be better by paying attention to the small daily practices that will make you better, by consistently doing them.The greatest thing about Atomic Habits is that it accepts humans are weak. Motivation and will are transitory, says Clear. And so, he sets out an approach which allows us to work with who we are, rather than who we wish we were.This book is a series of simple messages, supporting a simple thesis: to make it easy for you to consistently repeat behaviours what will make you a better person.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 7 June 2020,One of the few personal development books worth having,5,,1

R2AJEXNFBZIVAS,Sep,"A marketing masterpiece.With all due respect to author's team exceptional ability to better market & monetize original authors' ideas, my two cents is that this is, at its best, a two-page worth of original content which is bulked into an unnecessarily verbose & repetitive three-hundred-something pages book that was mostly a waste of time.The literature not only targets the average Joe out there, but also repeats itself constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. And I mean, cons-tant-ly! (I wish this review becomes as successful!)So, to give you the tldr you'd need and save you the trouble:The author reads the Duhig's ""power of habit"" and Eyal's ""hooked"" books and starts summerizing ""his framework"" upon those original ideas. As he mentions himself:""Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special recognition for their influence on this image. This representation of the habit loop is a combination of language that was popularized by Duhiggâ€™s book, The Power of Habit, and a design that was popularized by Eyalâ€™s book, Hooked.""Here's the original content and the framework he proposes:For good habits:- Make it obvious (cue)- Make it attractive (craving)- Make it easy (response)- Make it satisfying (reward)Do the opposite for the bad ones. And he calls it ""The Four Laws of Behavior Change"". And the rest is considerable loads of examples and repeatitions. Yup. Millions of sales. Magic.Yup, it's totally fine to expand & build upon others' ideas. It's how human knowledge grows. But come on, it's just 4 sentences. Ok, add one paragraph explanation per each, one example per each and then one page conclusion and that'd be a nice blog post I'd enjoy.â€”P.S.

I've lost weight multiple times in the past but only to regain it all back. While some of the concepts in the book aren't new , i've read similar books such as 'Mini Habits' by Stephen Guise , 'The Slight Edge' by Jeff Olson and Kaizen Way by Dr Robert Maurer. Atomic Habits are all those books put together on steroids.James Clear explains how setting goals are not the answer but you should focus on  'systems' instead. The system is simply to repeat good habits everyday by making them easy to do, attractive and rewarding.

Systems are about the processes that lead to those results."". He goes on to talk about how it's usually the system you need to tweak to create habits in order to reach your goals. Subconsciously I realized this but I never really actively thought about it and how I can actively try and tweak my mini-habits to accomplish the things I wanted.I love that at the end of each chapter there is a wrap up of the key points covered in that chapter.

RKSHUAMZS28NI,Some random family,"I've read many self improvement books, and with all honesty none have gotten to the point and showed you what to do as well as James Clear has done in this book. Moreover the thing I love the most about implementing the strategies he gives, is that they're really simple and easy to start.When trying to start something new we usually bite too much than we can chew. For example if you want to become fit and aim to go to the gym, you're first few sessions may be really intense but then soon after you'll leave the whole habit. We're trying to improve a habit that we haven't even built. And so instead it is better to start with something as dead simple as just staying at the gym for five minutes, and then steadily increasing it. Long term rather than short term.Moreover, once you finish this book there are several several wonderful articles on his website; Jamesclear.comAll in all, you can't go wrong with this my friend.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 22 June 2020,A Fantastic and Realistic Book!  -  The Best Self-Improvement Book I've Read,5,,0

I guess partly because the strategies the author suggests are so concrete and feasible. Nothing esoteric. Iâ€™ve still got a lot of work to do on improving my habits, but I think the best takeaway from this book is: donâ€™t aim to be perfect, aim to be consistent. Itâ€™s okay if you miss a day. Just donâ€™t miss two. As he says , â€œOnce is an accident. Twice is the start of a bad habitâ€.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 11 November 2021,Best Self-Improvement Book Iâ€™ve Read in a While,5,,0

As a general rule you know something is spot-on when it had never occurred to you before, but after reading it, it just seems so obvious.  This book is focused mainly on 1) on setting up systems such as your environmental factors of how you make good or bad habits easier or harder for yourself [e.g. having potato chips in plain view on the counter, or putting your workout clothes out the night before] and 2) how to identify habits, set up goals and hold yourself to them.

RBLKEFIV2RZTV,CG,"â€œMaking a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habitsâ€”not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. That said, it doesnâ€™t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.â€œThis book is about strategically building your ideal life and your ideal self. Itâ€™s so easy to imagine how we wish our lives and ourselves were different, but when it comes to taking action, it can be almost paralyzing. We donâ€™t know where to start, we have unconscious beliefs that sabotage ourselves at every turn, environments that no longer serve us, and action plans that lead to burn out, frustration, and backsliding. Jamesâ€™ book offers solutions to all of these problems. With a little clarity, patience and openmindedness, this bookâ€™s wisdom put to use will get you moving towards where youâ€™d like to be.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 25 October 2018,"Very practical advice that leads to simple, high-yield action.",5,,2

R29UC8KETZCXZS,Maggie,"The reason that I picked the book is because of Ali Abdaal (A famous Youtuber)â€™s video who mentioned: â€œthe score takes care of itself.â€ (from Bill Walsh). This is what I want exactly. People always tell me set an annual target, break it down to daily, it will be easier for me to achieve it. In fact, it turns out stress and disappointment frequently. I donâ€™t understand why everyoneâ€™s method doesnâ€™t work for me; I have been doubting myself until this book releases me. I am not the one who can keep looking the scores and achieve it at the end. In fact, I am the one who sets the target and keep doing it under stress-free condition. Another useful thing is filling out the sentence ofÂ IÂ willÂ [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. I told myself: I will finish reading Atomic Habits by Sunday at Home. I only request myself to read when I am free. Yesterday, I finished reading Atomic Habits at 11pm at home.

I was really, really, REALLY awful at it... yet I do my best work when I get up early. (To me, early is 6.30 am.) I made one simple change based on this book, and now I get up at 6.30 every day. I know, I know, it's a tiny thing â€“ but it's a big deal to me.And that's not the only way my life has changed for the better.This book is on my ""must read every year"" list, not just because it's full of actionable, practical, non-judgemental advice and info, but because it's an enjoyable read. I teach business owners how to write books, and this is one of the best I've read. There's no filler. No boring preaching.

Seems like the author really had to go out of his way to get the word count up to create hundreds of pages of words which could have really just have been a short story. Pretty much all of the stuff in this book is common sense, which to be fair to the Author not a lot of people are born with so if you are looking for some sort of revelation within the pages I am afraid you will be sorely disappointed. For those who have absolutely no idea of how to help yourself and create positive rather habits and remove negative ones may find some use in this book, other reviews would suggest that I am in the minority here so if you do find something then more power to you but for me, None of this was new news and could have been said in much fewer words, much like this review...",Reviewed in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ on 20 October 2021,A Struggle,3,,8

I've read over 40 books this year and I'd consider this book to be one of my personal top 3 most impactful book of 2018.I admit that I am a recovering perfectionist and put a lot of pressure on myself to excel at goals I've set out for myself. After reading this book, instead of focusing on goals I've listed out processes and micro habits it will take to ""become"" the person I want to identify with. I can already feel a huge amount of pressure taken off. Side note: I also love how each chapters start out with a short story relevant to the chapter topic.

R257BQNOPG8N21,J,"I've been reading James Clear's work for a long time.  In fact, I can remember his first two blogs, one for photography and the other was Passive Panda.  Since that time his exploration of habits and how to modify them has easily equaled or surpassed the work of Charles Duhigg.I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve and build good habits or stifle and destroy bad ones.  As I have the audio version,  one of the reasons I give the book 4/5 is due to the speed at which he speaks, which is not bad and I admit to being spoilt by the professional narrators of two other audiobooks in, Deep Work and Rejectionproof. The other reason is the reliance on the work of social scientists, psychologists, etc.  I realize that a number of books in the self-improvement space use scientific studies from the above-mentioned fields but the scandals concerning p-hacking and failure to replicate experiments make me wonder how valid the examples in this book and books like it really are.Having said all of that, I would not have stuck with James all these years if he did not provide information that was useful and more importantly, actionable.

R181BM344XY0VK,GTO,"The opening of this book is a bit shocking: James Clear's re-telling of a serious baseball injury - but it appears he's recovered and has gone on to write some amazing stuff, including this book. I got the audiobook on CD. James has a great voice and delivery style. He has nice summaries after each chapter. The advice is very good. He definitely addresses the shortcomings that we all have when attempting to set goals (lack of time, lack of committment - or the reverse, when we're TOO eager to start new habits and end up burning out).

Very concise, clear, sequential, useful writing that is easy to understand and apply without being boring or taking too long to read. Feels like a structured essay that was brutally pared down to the most important parts.  Chapters are short explanations/summaries of various concepts and strategies (usually focused on one per chapter along with a story or real life example) that are simplified and then fitted to a lightweight, easy to remember framework, allowing for easy recall and individual contextual extrapolation in your real life. As always, different books are better or worse fits for different people at different points in their lives that have different tastes and usage cases.

R1GKVD5FFVI9RU,"Maurice ""Moe"" Yuruki","I would go so far as to say that ""Atomic Habits"" is the most important book in the genre of Personal Development. I own dozens of personal development books and I can say without hesitation; this is the ONE book that will actually deliver the transformation you are seeking.  James Clear does an excellent job of explaining how your ""habits"" dictate your ""outcomes"".""Atomic Habits"" clearly illustrates WHY you do the things you do.  More importantly, James Clear will show you how to transform your life with small (seemingly insignificant) changes in your daily behavior (your habits).  You will understand how these ""small changes"" will eventually compound into remarkable results.Buy this book, but don't just read it... STUDY IT... IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT!

He makes it very much clear (no pun intended) early on that the goal of his book is to offer as streamlined of a guide to building healthy habits as possible, no shortcuts, no beating around the book with fancy vocabulary.

Keep at it and the next thing you know, you're finally feeling productive and overall there is improvement on many levels. My only worry, and the reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the beginning of the book where the author goes on and on about his accomplishments. It smacked of incredible insecurity and unwarranted over the top bravado. I wish he'd had the confidence to just introduce his beliefs and system and allow the process to speak for itself, otherwise I think some people will just stop before they even get to what matters in the book. I'd say ignore the first 1/4, and read the really good ideas that, if you stick to them, even haphazardly in the beginning, eventually before you know it, it all falls into place.

Thanks to this understanding, it's easier to gain awareness about our own behaviour and, as a consequence, turns out to be very helpful to take action and move towards the direction we are looking for. I haven't given 5 stars just for a personal reason.

James covers it all.

So the first half of the book seemed really solid and explained a good approach to making incremental changes in your life.  After that, I found the book got distracted from the main theme.  There was discussion about the one thing in this aspect of your life and the one thing in another aspect of your life.  It seemed to me that this violated the overall thesis of the book.

This was not someone regurgitating what other people have written, but rather him taking all that he has learned and formulating it into a completed puzzle for our consumption.One thing that is tricky with books like this is that they are so easy to read that sometimes you forget they are only useful if you stop, think, and implement the suggestions into your day-to-day.

As with all books of this nature, merely listening is not enough; application and implementation is key to gaining value from it.There's a good amount of additional supporting material that you can download too (links are in the book).

R3310GLYMYSP31,Garry Evans,"Everyone has habits that need changing - things you need to stop doing (smoking, procrastinating) and things you need to start doing more of (exercising, writing). This is a useful guide to the tricks you can use to help you develop good habits and rid yourself of bad ones. For example: Habit needs to become part of your identity (not ""I have to go the the gym"", but ""I am a healthy person""). Make good habits easy to do and bad ones inconvenient (put fruit on your kitchen counter, but hide the cookies). Four points are key: Cue-craving-response-reward.All useful stuff - and worth reminding yourself of now and again. But there is nothing terribly new in this book. I preferred Charles Duhigg's earlier ""The Power of Habit"". This book is worth a quick read, and some of the examples are fun. Certainly, if you follow some of the hints, you will acquire better habits. But not worth five stars.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 17 December 2018,Useful - but Duhigg is better,4,,26

R1FQYJBL5M4FEK,thiago,"The book is not bad. I really got the impression that the author put some good amount of effort writing it and, most importantly, he seems to believe in what he is writing. However, it builds mostly on things which are really obvious for someone who is more than 30 yo and is already after education and has got a job, family etc. In one way of another, I think that everyone is already applying the ""techniques"" from this book in their daily life without thinking about it. While reading I recognized things which I do a few times, but never really had the ""aha!"" moment. But a good reminder sometimes.I just don't give 4 stars because those ""graphs"" are an insult to my intelligence.

Don't get me wrong, it's good to have all these behaviour tips from lots of different experts in one place. Let's face facts, it saves you having to read all the books James Clear has read on the subject. And I'll undoubtedly re-read it and extract notes next time. But from my initial read, I just felt there was something not quite right about it. It didn't quite flow. Like it wasn't put together in the right order, know what I mean?

When it arrived, I noticed the book along with its pages were bent up.After looking closely at the front of the book, I noticed the alignment of the font for: â€œThe International Bestsellerâ€ was off. Itâ€™s not centred at all. In addition, the pages were printer paper thin and you can see right through to the other pages as well. If you like highlighting your books while reading, this is no good because the highlighter will bleed onto the other pages.Also, the font is extremely tiny and you can just tell that this is a carbon copy of the real book thatâ€™s being sold in store or on other bookstores online. Iâ€™ve also seen this book in person at a bookstore! So I just knew this purchase was off.I buy the majority of my books on Amazon because itâ€™s cheaper and I love itâ€™s efficient service. However, I am very disappointed in this purchase and Lux Canada should be flagged.Thereâ€™s no need to replicate books and then profit from it. Thatâ€™s not honest or fair.With good judgment and a few scans through the book, you can easily tell by the quality and make of this book is that it was photocopied.Please be aware and do your due diligence when buying books outside of your local bookstore, but most importantly from Lux Canada.Amazon, please look into this!",Reviewed in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ on 20 July 2022,Beware!

I had fallen into the same trap the author writes about. I would set an ambitious goal, with no particular system for achieving that goal. I wasn't consistent about my goals. Sometimes I did the small 1% steps to get to the goal, other times I would do something a few times and give up. It was purely by chance whether I would stick to something or not.

RSV2RS9VM1EPL,Tokolosh,"I have been receiving James Clear's newsletter for several months so when the book got out I ordered the kindle version immediately. But while the newsletter is occasionally interesting, the book is rather empty. There's nothing new, it's just a rehash of other books on the subject. There is no new perspective, no new insights. And there's nothing atomic about it. I am really disappointed, and I could not believe that the book became an instant best seller. If you have never read anything about habit forming, you will benefit from this book. But if you have, I don't see what you can get from Atomic Habits. I am also becoming tired of all the personal success stories from book authors because they can't be applied to the layman. I found there was nothing to learn from James' baseball days, as I never was an athlete and never excelled in sport. Feels like the average reader can't do this.

R35OH9OGNDPFMD,Philipp,Ich habe einige BÃ¼cher zu dem Thema Gewohnheiten abzulegen oder aufzubauen gelsen aber dieses Buch sticht von allen so dermaÃŸen heraus.  James Clear ist gerade zu Gott was das Thema angeht und VOR ALLEM: das Buch ist extrem praktikabel angelegt und verliert sich nicht allzusehr wie andere BÃ¼cher das tun ohne wirklich hilfreich zu sein oder Anleitungen zu geben in endlosen Geschichten und Anekdoten. Geschichten dienen hier allein dazu um die anzuwendenden Punkte unzusetzen. Ich bin dank dem Buch viel effiktiver und strukturierter geworden. Ich gehe mittlerweile 4 mal die Woche zum Sport was mir vorher als unmÃ¶glich erschien und viel zu radikal. Das ist nur EIN Beispiel welchen Einfluss das Buch auf mich hatte.

The principles of developing and maintaining good habits are outlined and explained but also interesting anecdotes and suggestions are weaved into each chapter which keeps it interesting. Reading just 1-2 chapters a day gave me chance to reflect on how to apply each set of principles to myself.One example - as a result of reading this book, every night before bed I leave my tablets for the morning on my sit-up machine which reminds me to do a few sets of crunches before I take them the next day.

RDCQHM68PXRXX,Alberto Vargas,"I bought this book because I am a big believer in building habits and predictable routines in one's personal and work life. I read the whole book. I was disappointed.Pros:- Links identity and habits. You are what you do. From that point of view, just going to the gym makes you the type of person who works out, even if you don't do much of a workout.- Introduces the idea that habits bring cumulative benefits like compound interest. While not obviously always the case, it's a powerful idea that definitely applies in areas like meditation or physical training, where the observable changes are minimal at first.Cons:- The book doesn't delve into examples of good habits and the why and how to build them. It stays at the meta / generic level, leaving the reader to think about what habits they may want to build.- The overall principles for building good habits are sound, even if high level and a bit obvious (make the good habits easy, the bad ones hard, etc).- The book is way too long for what it has to convey. Often things repeat or you wonder when the next chapter or thought will start, and when that happens, you lose track of what the earlier one was about -- mainly due to their length.Overall, not recommended.",Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 15 May 2019,Generic and relatively obvious,2,,41

More importantly, my resistant butt is exercising again, reading more and watching less mindless tv so that's proof enough for me.

RDI65D4QC4R2Q,Mavieestbelle,"This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to build good habits and break bad ones (And who doesn't ?).Unlike most books I'd read on the subject, ""Atomic Habits"" is neither an autobiography nor a purely theoretical piece of writing. In fact, it is a real hands-on book and the strategies it contains can be applied immediately.The major concept of the book is to focus on small but consistent improvement. The author argues that ""just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results"". According to James Clear, there are four stages that are crucial when it comes to creating good habits (and breaking bad ones):1. Cue -Make it obvious (invisible)2. Craving - Make it attractive (unattractive)3. Response - Make it easy (difficult)4. Reward - Make it satisfying (unsatisfying)In my opinion ""Atomic Habits"" is a treasure for anyone seriously interested in personal development and self-improvement.",Reviewed in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on 1 November 2018,"A revolutionary, mind-blowing approach to habit-formation",5,,125

Incredible poor quality, torn pages, poor formatting, suddenly different fonts appear, etc.Content-wise: I kept reading many recommendations about this book and eventually bought it. Therefore, I probably held high expecations of it which were increased when James Clear claims that he would extend findings of luminaries such as B.F. Skinner. Long story short: he does not.From start to end the book remains very superficial. I am sure there are many good take aways for readers who have no prior (or scientific) knowledge about this topic. Others I recommend to watch a Youtube-Video of the author. That's all you need - the rest of the book are just stories.A better book for this type of content is ""Switch"" by the Heath brothers.Readers of this book should also be very cautious from a psychological perspective. Creating habits can be very helpful but if you overdue it (like it is frequently suggested in this book) you might be prone to a life characterized by compulsiveness and unease.",Reviewed in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on 21 April 2020,Disappointed,2,,7

# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Book-Reviews
<br>
➡️In this project, we have used Amazon Shopping app and performed sentiment analysis on different book reviews to find best book to purchase.
<br>
➡️We first collected books review data.
<br>
➡️Then we wrote code in R language, where we implemented three different libraries:-
 <br>
 1) tm - text mining.
 <br>
 2) Wordcloud.
 <br>
 3) Syuzhet.
<br>
➡️By using these libraries we sorted and cleaned all the data. We formed a word cloud for maximum appearing words.
<br>
➡️Then we created a sentiment score based on the words with strong emotions and words with weak emotions.
<br>
➡️Finally came to a conclusion using tableau visualization which represented which book is the most preferred one among the three to read.
